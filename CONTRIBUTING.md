# Contributing to the DataMiner connector documentation

For every connector that is developed for DataMiner, a corresponding documentation page should be available. These pages are added to the [dataminer-docs-connectors](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/dataminer-docs-connectors) GitHub repository.

- For more information on how you can create such documentation pages, see [Connector documentation](https://docs.dataminer.services/develop/devguide/Connector/ConnectorHelp/Connector_help_pages.html)

- For more information on how to contribute to the DataMiner documentation in general, refer to [Contributing to the DataMiner docs](https://docs.dataminer.services/CONTRIBUTING.html).
