## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed. The device does not require authentication.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

The connector is only used for monitoring, so no special settings are required.

## Notes

Currently, the API provided by the vendor is still in its infancy. This connector has been developed using the information available in version 3.0 of the API. However, this means that only the configuration on the device can be monitored, not the status of the signals and processes.
