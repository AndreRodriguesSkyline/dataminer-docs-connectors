# Emcore Medallion 6000

This connector retrieves information from the Emcore Medallion 6000 via SNMP. The Medallion 6000 series is a family of state-of-the-art high-performance 1550 nm externally-modulated CATV fiber-optic transmitters. Advanced features such as built-in field-adjustable SBS control and electronic dispersion compensation allow these transmitters to be quickly optimized in the field for any link or application without the need to procure specifically tuned transmitters.
