## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

## Note

Within a GV Orbit system, alarms are grouped into collections based around a device (sometimes called a "Unit"). Devices may be physical, such as a modular card, or virtual, such as a categorized alarm.

Devices are identified by a path, which may be a virtual Linux-style file system path (typical on Densite/iControl equipment) or a RollCall address in the format NNNN:UU:PP. The RollCall address has a logical path built in and can therefore be resolved to a path in a network tree.
