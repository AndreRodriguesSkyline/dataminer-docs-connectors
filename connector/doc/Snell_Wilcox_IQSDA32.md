# Snell Wilcox IQSDA32

The **Snell Wilcox IQSDA32** connector monitors and controls changes on the distribution amplifier unit through a **Rollcall** **smart-serial** protocol. The card is used in the **IQ Modular Chassis**.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *2050*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus of the card on the chassis. The default, *UU.PP (Hex)*, shows the expected structure of the address, where UU is the chassis ID, and the PP is the card position, both in Hex.

## Usage

### General

This page contains general information on the card hardware, including the **information shown on the display** of the device, and its various **versions** and **serial numbers**.

### Input

This page displays the basic configuration for each of the 2 available inputs. It allows you to configure the **SDI rates** and **On Signal Loss** behavior, as well to mute the channels.

### Memories

The page displays the configurable **User Memory** setting slots **1 to 16** of the device.

You can recall the settings from any of the previous slots with the **Recall Memory** option and check the last used memory setting slot in the **Last User Memory**.

To save a memory setting, first use the **Select Memory** parameter to either select one of the memory slots or select *None*, configure the name using the **Change Memory Name** parameter (which will be displayed for the corresponding **Memory Name Values** parameter), and select whether to **Save** or **Clear** the memory. Note that when you clear the memory, the configuration associated with it will be lost, and you will need to save it again later in order to re-create it.
