## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.

## How to use

The **General** page contains basic status parameters for the device.

The frame controller supports **more modules** fitted in the chassis. The connector will display these as instances. The names of the added card types can be found in the **Monitor Table** on the **Control** page.

For each of those modules, you can configure the input in the **Input Control Table** on the **Control** page. The connector handles the switching logic taking into account the fact that different cards supported by the connector (SWRF16B7703, SWRF8B7703, SWRF47703) have a different number of inputs available (16, 8, 4, respectively).
