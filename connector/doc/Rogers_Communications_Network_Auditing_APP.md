## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

On the **General** page, make sure to fill in the appropriate database information: the server **IP address**, the schema **Name**, and the **Username** and **Password**.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

In the **Polling Control** table, the connector will automatically list compatible elements it can gather data from to put into the database.

By default, all rows will be disabled. If you want the data of a specific element to be inserted into the database, **enable** the row and set the **polling frequency** to indicate how often you want the database to be updated.

The **Data Export** page allows you to export database tables to CSV files for storage. Note: These files will only be exported onto the DMA that hosts the Network Auditing APP element.

When element data has been successfully exported to the database, the **Polling Control** table will indicate the last time data was inserted. Polling error information will also be shown in this table.

## Notes
