# Ovarro Kingfisher - Digital Output

This connector is exported by the Ovarro Kingfisher connector. It represents a 16 digital output card in a Kingfisher RTU.

## About

This connector is automatically generated by the [Ovarro Kingfisher](xref:Connector_help_Ovarro_Kingfisher) parent connector, range 1.0.0.x.

## Configuration

A DVE using this connector can be **automatically created** by an element using the parent connector.

## Usage

The **General** page displays the information about each bit of the register that represents this card. That includes the raw value, the register, and potentially a destination element/PID.

The table can also be used to configure settings on a digital output to interact with an external element like a relay.
