## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### HTTP Connection

The connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy*.

### Initialization

The HTTP credentials, i.e. the username and password, need to be provided in a newly created element.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The SNMP connection is used to read and set device settings.

The HTTP connection is used both to read the system log and to retune the event log.
