SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

On the **General** page, you can find status and configuration parameters related to the device.

On the **Network** page, several tables are available:

- The **Network Interfaces Table** allows you to configure the IP addresses and contains different settings related to each interface.
- The **IP** **Configuration Table** allows you to select the state, ports, destination IPs etc. for each IP input/output.
- The **IP Statistics Table** displays information about the bit rate, jitter, etc.

The **TS Display** page contains transport stream and service information.

The **Satellite** page contains input 1 and 2 status parameters such as RF Level, BER and Symbol Rate. You can also configure parameters such as DVB Mode, Satellite Frequency, LNB Frequency, etc.

The **Headend** page contains status parameters related to ASI 1, 2 and 4, such as the bit rates. It also displays bit rates related to layer 1 to 7. Finally, it also allows you to configure the Product Mode, Main Source and Backup Source for the input.
