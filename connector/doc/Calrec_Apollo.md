### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the Calrec configuration server.
- **Device address**: The IP address of the corresponding network element. This IP will be used to filter the traps.

## Usage

Depending on the parameter, alarm monitoring is possible on the values in this table.

Note: You can remove selected rows or remove all rows in the table. Right-click the table and select the appropriate option.
