# SES S.A. TEMOS Probe

TEMOS is a system at SES S.A. that is able to retrieve satellite telemetry data from a server named TLMCore. The TLMCore is a socket server that handles XML requests. This protocol allows users to observe the telemetry data in the form of a table of channels.

## About

This protocol uses a serial connection to obtain the telemetry data from the TLMCore server.
