## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

### General

This page displays the **Panel Manager** **table**, which allows you to connect software panel elements to hardware panel elements. There can only be one software panel per hardware panel.

To add or remove links, use the right-click menu of the table.

### Hardware Panels

This page displays status information for the existing hardware panel elements.

You can also enable or disable the management of these elements. If you disable management, the panel manager will not be able to use them for the linking process.

Right-click the table to access the context menu, which allows you to add new hardware elements, remove them, or recreate them (if a specific element was removed but still has a record in the Hardware Panel table).

### Software Panels

This page displays status information for the existing software panel elements.

You can also enable or disable the management of these elements. If you disable management, the panel manager will not be able to use them for the linking process.

Right-click the table to access the context menu, which allows you to add new software elements, remove them, or recreate them (if a specific element was removed but still has a record in the Software Panel table).
