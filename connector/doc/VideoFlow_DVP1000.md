# VideoFlow DVP1000

The DVP1000 is a video stream-aware network device capable of protecting live video streams from the impact of network impairments. It ensures no packets are lost when content is delivered over the internet and nullifies the jitter caused by transiting the internet. Each DVP can be configured as "Protector", "Sentinel" or "Fortress".

This connector allows you to access various information on the device. There are different possibilities available for alarm monitoring and trending.
