## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP Port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default 161.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

## How to use

The element allows you to monitor and configure the Antenna Controller and normalize the RF level.

The **General** page contains the information about the device.

On the **Antenna Controller** page, the **Normalize RF Level** page button opens a page where you can add rows from the Port Table present in the connector.

The **Interfaces** page provides information about the available interfaces.
