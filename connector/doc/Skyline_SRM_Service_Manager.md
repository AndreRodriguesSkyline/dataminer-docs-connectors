## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

The connector exposes a receiver parameter (**Reservation JSON Receiver**, **PID 1**) that should receive a JSON Serialized **Service General** object.

This object will be deserialized and all info will be extracted. Once this is successful, an entry will be created in the **SRM Service Table** (on the General page), and a corresponding **service** will be created using the provided **service template**.

Each row in the SRM Service Table represents a service in the system. When a row gets added to this table (based on a request coming from LSO), a service creation request is executed, and the result of this request (Success or Failure) is shown in the **Creation State column**.

The **Service Action** buttons allow you to manipulate a service.
