## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: The device address.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page displays information about the device hardware, the device **Status**, the **PSU** **Status** and the **Input**/**Output** configuration.

### Input

This page contains the **Inputs** table. In this table, you can configure the **Name** of each input.

In version 1.0.0.2, the **Advanced** page button displays a semicolon-separated list of the input names.

### Output

This page contains the **Outputs** table, with the **Input Selection** for each output as well as the **Name** of each output.

With the **Revert** button, you can set a crosspoint back to the previous input.

### Matrix

This page displays a matrix with the size determined in the input/output configuration.

In this matrix, you can select crosspoints to define which input is connected to which output. You can also change the name of inputs and outputs by renaming the labels of the matrix.

### Traps

This page displays the received traps in the **Traps** table, as well as the total **Trap Count**.

Via the **Manage Traps** page button, you can change how traps are managed and removed in the **Traps** table.
