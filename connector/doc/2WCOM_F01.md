# 2WCOM FM01

The 2wcom FlexMon FM01 FM monitoring receiver combines demodulation, source-switching and FM/RDS parameter measurement/monitoring functionality. Its dual inputs can receive FM signals for rebroadcasting, monitoring, backup and alarming scenarios. An internal switch matrix changes between the inputs triggered by several states.

This connector retrieves information from the device via SNMP.
