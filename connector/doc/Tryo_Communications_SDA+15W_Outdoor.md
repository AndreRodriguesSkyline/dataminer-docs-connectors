# Tryo Communications SDA+15W Outdoor

The **Tryo Communications SDA+15W Outdoor** is used as a transmitter that transmits electromagnetic waves carrying messages and signals.

## About

This connector polls data from the **Tryo Communications SDA+15W Outdoor** via **SNMP** and displays the information on multiple pages with various tables and standalone parameters. Some parameters can be used to update data within the device by means of an SNMP set. The connector also handles traps, by parsing a trap for the OID of the parameter that caused the trap and repolling the parameter for an updated value.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *public*.

### LITE Mode

LITE mode reduces the number of polled parameters of this protocol in order to save bandwidth over GSM connections. To enable this functionality, use the toggle button on the **SNMP Config** subpage.

The following parameters are polled in this mode: Frequency, Service Mode, Temperature Status, Modulator Internal Temperature, SWR Status, GPS Lock, User RF Status, Secondary Input Storage Time, Transit Delay, C/N Ratio, Carrier Status, Satellite Receiver Frequency, TS Bit-Rate, Number of Satellites, Number of Satellites in sight, RF User, Power and RF SWR.
