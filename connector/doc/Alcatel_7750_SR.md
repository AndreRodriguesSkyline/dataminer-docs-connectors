# Alcatel 7750 SR

The **Alcatel-Lucent 7750 Service Router** is an industry-leading multi-service edge router designed for the concurrent delivery of advanced residential, business and mobile services on a common IP edge platform. The connector uses **SNMPv2** to retrieve the information and configuration settings from the router.

## About

The **Alcatel 7750 SR** protocol is used to control and monitor the services of the Alcatel 7750 SR via **SNMPv2**.

Because the connector is very large, it's possible to **enable or disable polling** on every page. Since version 1.0.0.4 of the connector, you can also enable or disable polling on table level. More information about the different possibilities and the default settings can be found in the "Notes" section at the bottom of this help file.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

**SNMP CONNECTION:**

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

**SNMP Settings:**

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used to write to the device. The default value is *private*.

## Notes

### Polling

As mentioned in the "About" section of this help file, it is possible to enable and disable polling for each individual table (from **version 1.0.0.4** of this connector onwards).

For existing elements (**using versions prior to 1.0.0.4**), the table polling will match the page level polling after (initial) startup. This means that if page polling is enabled, polling for all tables on that page will be enabled as well. Similarly, if page polling is disabled, table polling for all tables on that page will be disabled as well. Once the table polling parameters are initialized, their **configuration will be saved** and a restart of the element will not update their state to the state of the page polling parameter.

When page polling is changed, the tables on that page will inherit the new polling setting from the page. Changing the polling for a table, however, will not have any impact on the page polling or on the polling of any other tables on that page. The following example shows how this works for the **SDP** page in the connector:

The **SDP** page displays two tables: **SDP Info Table** and **SDP Bind Table**. When an element with the Alcatel 7750 SR connector is created, the SDP Polling is disabled on this page and both tables inherit this setting.

- When **SDP Polling** is enabled for this page, the **SDP Info Polling** table and **SDP Bind Polling** table will be enabled as well, and the data for these tables will be retrieved from the device.
- When **SDP Info Polling** is disabled again, the **SDP Info Polling** table will no longer be polled, but the **SDP Bind Table** will still be polled, because enabling or disabling polling on a table has no influence on the page or any other tables.
- When **SDP Polling** is disabled again, the **SDP Bind Table** polling will also be stopped, because it inherits this setting from the **SDP Polling**.
