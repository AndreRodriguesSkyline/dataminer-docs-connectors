## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following information during element configuration:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **IP port**: The port of the connected device.

## How to use

This is a serial connector that provides information about available **High Power Amplifiers (HPA)**, **Variable Phase Combiners (VPC)** and **Waveguide Switches** devices. Information about the different kinds of devices is displayed on different, corresponding pages: **HPA**, **VPC** and **WGSW**.

When a negative acknowledge (NAK) response is received in the communication, the connector displays the reason for the NAK response and the date and time when the NAK response is received. You can find this information on the General page, along with report-related parameters.
