This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, e.g. 4009
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Range: 0 to 9.

## How to use

The element consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page shows information about the device configuration, such as the sensor ID, user alarms, baud rate, etc.

It also provides access to a Debug page, which shows the response of the GET and POLL commands. You can also check the configured bus address.

### METAR message

This page shows all the parameters that come in the METAR POLL message, such as Message ID, Sensor ID, Visibility, Intensity, Relative Humidity, User Alarms, etc.

There is also a table summarizing the message that comes from the METAR code.
