# Evertz 7880DM4-ISDBT-IP

This connector is used to monitor and control the **Evertz 7880DM4-ISDBT-IP** card. The Evertz 7880DM4-ISDBT-IP is used to demodulate digital terrestrial ATSC/8VSB/ISDB-Tb, QAM/ DVBC/ DVB-C2 cable signals, DTV signals or digital DVB-S/S2 satellite signals.

An **SNMP** connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the information of the device. There are also different possibilities available for **alarm monitoring** and **trending**.

## How to use

Depending on the connector range, the element created with this connector consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page contains the general information about the device, such as the **Data Port**, **System** and **System Preset** information.

### IP Input

This page contains a **tree view** that allows you to navigate through and efficiently manage information from the Demodulator Control Table, the Demodulator Table and other standalone parameters from different tables.

### Input

This page contains the **Demodulator Table**, which allows you to manage and control parameters such as the **Frequency** and **Bandwidth**.

It also contains the **Demodulator Control Table**, which controls the status of the DVEs.

### IP Input Control

This page provides access to the **IP Input Controls**. It allows you to enable or disable the **Stream**, as well as set the **Receive Mode**, **Multicast** **IP**, **UDP Port**, **RTP Protocol**, **Clear Status** and **IGMPV3 Mode**.

### TS Path

This page contains the **TS Input Table**, which allows you to monitor parameters such as the **Bitrate** and to configure the **Main** and **Backup Source**.

From version **1.0.1.2** onwards, this page also contains the **ASI Configuration Table.**

### Output

This page contains two tables that are linked. The first is the **IP Output Stream Table**, which provides the controls for each specific output. Each output has a corresponding stream, for which all related controls can be found in the table. This same functionality can be found in the other table, **TS Output**.

### Output Service

This page contains three tables that are related with the IP Output Stream Table of the previous page: **Service Filter Control Table, Service Filter Program Table** and **Service Filter PID Table.**

### Output Tree

From version **1.0.1.2** onwards, this page contains a tree view that allows you to efficiently navigate through the information from the previous two pages. Each node has a user-friendly description.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.
