# IneoQuest iVMS ASM - Inspector Probe

The Inspector probe will keep track of a large number of program streams for real-time linear and/or ABR preparation and delivery. Because these streams must be encoded or transcoded, and checked for regulatory compliance before being sent downstream to viewers, it is of high importance to monitor the status of these programs and streams.

This connector is automatically generated by the connector **IneoQuest iVMS ASM**.
