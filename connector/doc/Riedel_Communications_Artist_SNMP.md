SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).

## How to use

The element has the following data pages:

- **General**: Contains general parameters such as Version, Main IP Address Type, Main IP Address, Node Count and Client Card Count.
- **Alarms**: Contains the **Alarms Table**, which lists all alarms present in the system. Its index is the creation time as a Unix timestamp/path.
