# Advantech AMT Monitor and Control Panel

This is an SNMP connector that shows the status of the different parameters of an Advantech AMT Monitor and Control Panel.

The Advantech AMT Monitor and Control Panel consists of a control panel and several modules (SSPAs, Transceiver).

The connector shows all information in table format, the same way as it is stored in SNMP. This is also the case even if a table only consists of one row. There is no web interface to control the device.
