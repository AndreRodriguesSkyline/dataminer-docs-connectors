- **Toggle Polling Speed**: Allows you to toggle between *Normal Polling* and *Fast Polling* of the parameters of the device.

### Admin - Access / SNMP

On this page, you can configure the host's IP addresses, as required to enable communication with the CDM-625 web server interface and to set administration information for the CDM-625 Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature.

These options are only available when the device is working in *Local* mode (see "Config - Utilities" section below).

- Host Access List:

- **Access List**: Allows you to grant access via HTTP and SNMP to a defined list of client machines.
  - **Access List Overview**: Allows you to define which remote clients can connect when Access List is *Enabled*. Each entry allows you to specify an **IP Address** and a **Subnet Mask** to define a unique class of machines that are allowed access.

- SNMP:

- **Trap IP 1 / Trap IP 2:** Allow you to assign up to two SNMP trap IP addresses.
  - **Trap Version:** Allows you to set the trap version to *SNMPv1* or *SNMPv2* using the drop-down list.
  - **Trap Community String:** Allows you to assign the SNMP trap community string. The community string must consist of a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20 alphanumeric characters.

### Admin - FAST

The CDM-625 has a number of optional features that can be activated after the unit's purchase. Fully Accessible System Topology (FAST) Access Codes are register-specific, unique authorization codes that can be purchased from Comtech EF Data.

- **Equipment ID:** This **read-only** section displays the operational status for a number of FAST-enabled features.
- **Hardware:** The list displays the **installed** and presently operational FAST-enabled features as well as the **non-installed** FAST-enabled features that are available for purchase and activation from Comtech EF Data.

### Config - Modem

Use this page to configure modem operating (Tx/Rx) parameters:

- Tx/Rx Interfaces and Framing: The **Tx**/**Rx** **Interface Types** and **Framing Modes** have **higher priority** over the other parameters. They should be configured before other parameters are set.
- Tx/Rx operating parameters: Remaining parameters for configuration.
- Carrier-in-Carrier (CnC) parameters: Click the **CnC** page button to access CnC configurable parameters.
- ACM parameters: Click the **ACM** page button to access ACM configurable parameters.

### Config - LAN - IP

Use this page to configure LAN IP-related parameters. Some options are only available when the device is working in *Local* mode (see "Config - Utilities" section below).

The **Network Configuration** section consists of the following parameters:

- **IP Gateway**: The IP address of the default gateway. Applicable only if Working Mode is set to *Managed Switch*.
- **Traffic/Mgmt IP Address** (and subnet mask): Can be used to configure the modem's IP addresses.
- **MAC Address:** The MAC address of the Ethernet port. This parameter is read-only and cannot be changed.
- **MAC Learning:** Applicable only if Working Mode is set to *Managed Switch*. Use the drop-down menu to set MAC Learning to *On* or *Off*.

Use the drop-down menu to select *Port 1*, *Port 2*, *Port 3* or *Port 4* as the dedicated management port. If *Port 1 (2, 3, 4) - Local Only* is selected, management is restricted to LAN only. Note that when the optional IP Packet Processor is *Enabled*, the drop-down menu displays *Disabled*. When VLAN Mode is *Enabled*, the drop-down menu displays all previously described options, but it will not be possible to select any of them.
- **2048 Ethernet Frame Size:** This feature is only supported on modems with hardware revision 2.X or higher. Set this feature to *Disabled* or *Enabled*.
- **Working Mode:** Use the drop-down menu to select one of the following working modes: *Managed Switch*, *Router Point-to-Point*, *Router Multipoint Hub* or *Router Multipoint Remote*.

- **Pause Flow Control:** Set Pause Flow Control for the port to *Off* or *On*.
- **Native Mode:** Set Native Mode for the port to *Disabled* or *Enabled*.
- **PVID:** When Native Mode is *Enabled*, a PVID (Native VLAN ID) may be assigned to the selected port using a value range of *0001-4095*.
- **Priority:** Use the drop-down menu to set the operational priority of the selected port, in the order of preference (from *1* to *4*).
- **Actual Negotiated Port Speed:** This is the status of the current actual operating speed and duplex. If the port is not connected, "*Link Down*" is displayed.

VLAN Mode: This mode is supported if Working Mode is set to *Managed Switch*, with or without the optional IP Packet Processor enabled. The **VLAN Mode** section contains the following parameters:

- **VLAN Mode:** Set the mode to *Disabled* or *Enabled*.
- **Management VLAN ID:** A management VLAN ID can be assigned to the selected port using a value range of *0001-4095*.

Below this, you can find the **VLAN Table**, which contains the following parameters:

- **VLAN ID:** This parameter is read-only and reflects the ID value assigned in de PVID column of the Per Port Configuration Table (i.e. any ID has a value range of 0001-4095).
- **Port 1** through **Port 4:** Use the drop-down menu to set the port to *Untagged*, *Tagged* or *Filtered***.**
- **VLAN Row Status:** You can use the button to **Delete** the VLAN ID.
- **Create VLAN:** Allows you to create a new VLAN ID.

### ODU / Redundancy

Use this page to enable or disable communication with CSAT/KST ODUs for 70/140 MHz operation or LPOD BUCs for L-band operation, and to set up redundancy.

In the ODU section, you can use the **ODU Comms** parameter to set the ODU operation to *Disabled* or *Enabled*.

In the **Redundancy** section, you can configure the following parameters:
