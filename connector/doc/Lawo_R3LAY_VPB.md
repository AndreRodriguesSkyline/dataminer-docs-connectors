## How to Use

This connector uses EmberPlus. It first discovers all the possible nodes and puts them in the Ember tree. If some nodes are not available during the initial discovery, they will be discovered in the next timer sequence.

You can trigger manual discovery of nodes by clicking **Start Node Discovery** on the **General** page. This will discover the nodes again if they are available.

Every five seconds, the discovered tables are updated. If a table has not been updated for 30 minutes, this table data will be cleared.
