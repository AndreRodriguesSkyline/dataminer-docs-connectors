## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

On the **Source Destination Config** page, you can configure up to three sources and destinations of what is included in the service. Then you can configure in which cases alarms need to be generated on the **Alarm Configuration** page.

If the **Customer** property is configured to one of the known users for this protocol (NPO, RTL or Discovery), the configuration will automatically be pushed when the expected service elements are available.

## How to Use

Based on the configuration (see Initialization), alarms will be generated in the Alarms table. If no configuration is available, this will be indicated by an alarm.

## Notes

This protocol was developed for specific users for the B2B project.
