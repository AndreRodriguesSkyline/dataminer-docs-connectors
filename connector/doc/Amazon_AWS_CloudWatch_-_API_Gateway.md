# Amazon AWS CloudWatch - API Gateway

CloudWatch can be used to monitor API execution, which collects and processes raw data from API Gateway into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that historical information can be accessed to gain a better perspective on how the web application or service is performing. By default, API Gateway metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in one-minute periods.

### General

The General page contains the **Entry ID** that is a unique identifier for this service. The **Entry Type** provides more insight in the different parts that the **Entry ID** consists of. The **Polling Interval** can be modified on this page and the **Entry Status** indicates if the service entry is still present. With the **Force Polling** button, you can poll the metrics immediately without having to wait until the interval time has elapsed.

### API Gateway Metrics

The API Gateway Metrics page contains all polled metric values. Polling of the appropriate metric can be enabled via the **Config Poll** page button. It is not possible to set the Poll parameter to *Enabled* for metric parameters that have the *N/A* value. These *N/A* metrics are not present in the provided metrics list for this instance and hence their Poll parameter will remain *Disabled*.
