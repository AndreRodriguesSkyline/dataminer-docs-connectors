### Connections

#### IP Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus/unit address of the device.

## How to use

The **General** page displays device name and software version information.

On the **Switching Control** page, it is possible to change/configure the **Control** and **Operation** modes of the device. Note that setting the Operation mode to *Automatic* will not work in some cases (if both sites are transmitting, if there is a specific (configurable) pattern of switches, or if at least one polarization is not in maintenance mode). On this page, **before you try to** **switch to site 1** **or** **2**, make sure to select the **Polarization** and **Chains** that need to be switched.
