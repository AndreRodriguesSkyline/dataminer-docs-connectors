Via the page buttons, e.g. **SCTE 104**, additional information is available.

### Video monitoring

On this page, the **Monitoring Behavior Control** table allows you to enable or disable monitoring of all inputs, as well as to switch between the main or backup input.

The **Input Monitoring Control Table** allows you to specify the conditions for which a fault will be raised on the device.
