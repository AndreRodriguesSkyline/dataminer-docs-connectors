## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

When you have created a new element, configure the following parameters on the **General** page:

- **Max Scans**: Limits the maximum number of scan operations.
- **Customer Selection**: Limits the scans to one customer or to a comma-separated list of customers. If you specify *All*, they will run for all customers.
- **Max Running Scans**: Determines the maximum number of concurrent scans.
- **Max Scan Time**: Determines if the concurrent scans should be reduced or increased. They will not go over the value specified with **Max Running Scans**.

## How to Use

On the **General** page:

- The **Start** button will discover the existing CDMR Agents in the system. The Agents will be filtered based on the user configuration of **Customer Selection** and **Max Scans.** The filtered Agents will be marked as **Pending Scans**. From these pending scans, the connector will select a number of **Running Scans**.
  The running scans have several possible outcomes:

- **Completed**: The scan was successfully completed.
  - **Not Running Long Enough**: There is not enough information to run the scan.
  - **Error**: An error occurred during the scan execution.

- The **Stop** button will stop the scan operation by removing the **Pending Scans** and **Running Scans.**
