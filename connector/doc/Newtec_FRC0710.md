The **Alarm Status page** displays the **Alarm Table**, which contains an overview of the state of all the possible alarms in the system. If an alarm has the status Fail, you can manually clear the alarm by clicking the corresponding **Clear** button. You can also see the corresponding Alarm Count, and you can reset this value to zero by clicking the **Reset** button.

On the **Control page**, you can set several parameters related to different aspects of input and output signals, like gain, operation bands and frequencies.

The **Alarm Settings page** contains parameters that allow you to enable/disable the **Overload** and **Underload** input alarms and the respective thresholds.
