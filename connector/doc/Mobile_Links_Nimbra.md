## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

When the element has been created, on the **General** page, specify the **API Secret**.

## How to use

On the **General** page of this connector, you can configure the **API Secret**, and there is also a **Matrix Display** toggle button that allows you to enable or disable the matrix UI of the element.

On the **Sources** and **Destinations** pages, you can find the Sources and Destinations tables, respectively.
