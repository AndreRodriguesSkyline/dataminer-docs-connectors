## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Connection

This connector uses a TCP/IP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device (by default 645).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

This connector will allow monitoring and control of the ACU. No special actions are required to use it.

The connector creates a TCP client to retrieve all data from the ACU, so no data will be available in Stream Viewer.
