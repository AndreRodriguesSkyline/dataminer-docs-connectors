# Adtec RD-71

Adtec Digital's RD-71 is an SD, HD and 1080P59.94/50 IRD supporting MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, multi-CHROMA 4:2:0/4:2:2 and 10-bit. With support for very low latency decoding, an array of IP transport capabilities and DVB-S2X demodulation, the RD-71 is both versatile and reliable.

## About

This connector was designed for use with the device **Adtec RD-71**. The connector retrieves and sets information from/on the device via SNMP. To support profiles, the connector uses a serial connection (Telnet).

## Notes

When you move to range 1.0.4.x, existing elements need to be recreated before the new connection will be used. This is because connection changes (adding or removing a connection) do not take effect when you upgrade an existing element to the new protocol version. The connections are only created when the element is created.

**Actions to be taken**: DMS element reconfiguration.

**Advised method**: Bulk configuration can be performed using export/import functionality.
