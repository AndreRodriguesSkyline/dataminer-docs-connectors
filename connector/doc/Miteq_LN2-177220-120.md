# Miteq LN2-177220-120

The Miteq LN2-177220-120 is a 1:2 redundant low-noise amplifier system designed to ensure continuous operation without disruption of signal transmission. A fault condition in the online LNA or an operator-generated command will switch the standby LNA to the online position and remove the online LNA from the signal path. The redundant LNA system consists of an outdoor amplifier/switch assembly that mounts at the antenna hub, a rack-mounted indoor local control unit and an interconnection control cable.
