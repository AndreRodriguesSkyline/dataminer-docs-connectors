# Tektronix SPG8000

The SPG8000 is a precision multiformat video signal generator, suitable for master synchronization and reference applications. It provides multiple video reference signals, such as black burst, HD tri-level sync, and serial digital and composite analog test patterns. It also provides time reference signals such as time code and NTP (Network Time Protocol).

## About

The connector polls information from the Tektronix SPG8000 via an SNMP connection. Traps are also implemented; the necessary data will be refreshed as soon as a trap is received.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The IP port of the device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

#### Serial API connection \[1.0.1.x\]

In range 1.0.1.x, this connector also uses a serial connection to poll the API.

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SERIAL Settings:

- **Port number**: 5000
- **Bus address**: None/disabled by default.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the data pages detailed below.

### General

This page contains general information that is retrieved from the device, such as **Firmware Version**, **Hardware Status**, **Main** and **CPU temperature** and **Battery Status.**

### LEDs

This page contains information about the status of the LEDs on the front panel of the device: **Interior LED**, **Exterior LED**, **Time LED** and **Fault LED**.

### Voltage

This page contains information about the different voltages from the different sections of the device, such as **Main Board +5.0V**, **Main Board +3.3V**, **Slot 1 +5.0V**, **Slot 2 +3.3V**, **Slot 3 +8.0AV**, **Slot 4 +5.0AV**, etc.
