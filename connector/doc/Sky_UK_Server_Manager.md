## How to use

The following pages are available:

- **General**: Shows a status overview of the elements included in the service. Also contains the DMA and Service update status.
- **Alarms**: Shows the alarm information that is built/updated based on the workflow.
- **Servers**: Shows memory and CPU information for the subscribed Linux servers. You can configure memory and CPU thresholds, above which the workflow will generate warning and critical alarms.
- **Subscriptions**: Contains the subscription information of the subscribed parameters.
- **App**: Lists the apps/processes running on the subscribed Linux servers.
- **Mounts**: Lists the mount points available on the subscribed Linux servers.
- **Config**: Allows you to configure the names and different threshold values for the desired mounts and apps. The mount point that defines whether a server is active or not is configured in the Desired Mounts table. Via the **VCS Config** page button, you can configure the VCS filters used for the filtering of the VCS traps.
- **VCS**: Displays the list and status of the Splunk elements, as well as traps information. Click the Delete button in the Traps table to remove an entry from the Traps Table of the corresponding VCS element.
