- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

#### WebSocket Nodes Connection (range 1.0.1.x)

From range 1.0.1.x onwards, this connector also uses a WebSocket connection.

WEBSOCKET CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination \[ws://IP\].
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

## How to use

The element created with this connector consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Allows you to select the node, connection, and events version to be polled. You can also specify at which rate the information should be polled.
- **Node:** Contains all node-related information.
- **Connection:** Contains all connector-related information.
- **Events:** Contains all events-related information.
- **Subscriptions**: Allows you to determine whether the sources are polled or updated by subscription.

## Notes

The current implementation of this connector is focused on Node version v1.3, Connection version v1.1, and Events version v1.1. Changing these versions may change the current results.
