## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

When you have created a new element, make sure all necessary SNMP settings and Telnet credentials are properly configured.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product. It provides a comprehensive set of monitoring and configuration options, similar to the command line interface.

## How to Use

The connector uses SNMP to retrieve the device information from the PTF 3207A that is displayed the General page of the element. Telnet is used to retrieve the data displayed on the Status, Module A, and Module B pages. The configuration options in the connector include enabling or disabling modules and adjusting Telnet settings such as polling state, timer, timeout, and status.

### General Page

The **General** page displays device company info, product information, and data information.

### Status Page

The **Status** page displays a detailed summary of the status of module A and B.

### Module A and Module B Pages

On these pages, you can find the Receiver 1 and Receiver 2 configuration, module system parameters, network parameters, and date/time parameters for module A and B, respectively.

### Configuration Page

This page includes three sections:

- **Module State**: Enables or disables module A and module B polling. If polling is disabled for a module, the respective page will be hidden.
- **Credentials**: Used for Telnet authentication.
- **Telnet Settings**: Controls the polling state, timer, timeout for a single command, and polling status (*Idle*, *Processing*, or *Failed*).

## Notes

The PTF 3207A connector ensures accurate time and frequency outputs by synchronizing with various input signals. Proper configuration of SNMP and Telnet settings is crucial for reliable operation. The flexibility of enabling or disabling modules and adjusting polling settings allows for tailored monitoring and management of the device.
