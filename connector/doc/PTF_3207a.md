## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. (default: *public*)
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. (default: *private*)

### Initialization

Additional configuration of parameters may be necessary in a newly created element. Ensure all necessary SNMP settings and Telnet credentials are properly configured.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined for this connector.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product. It provides a comprehensive set of monitoring and configuration options, similar to the command line interface.

## How to Use

The connector functions by utilizing SNMP to pull device information from the PTF 3207A and display it on the General page of the connector. Telnet is used to pull data and display it on the Status, Module A, and Module B pages of the connector. Configuration of the device includes enabling or disabling modules and adjusting Telnet settings such as polling state, timer, timeout, and status.

### General Page

The **General** page includes parameters pulled from SNMP, displaying device company info, product information, and data information.

### Status Page

The **Status** page includes two parameters, one for Module A status and another for Module B status, each providing a detailed summary of the respective module's status.

### Module A and Module B Pages

The **Module A** and **Module B** pages include parameters related to their respective modules. These pages cover Receiver 1 and Receiver 2 configuration, module system parameters, network parameters, and date/time parameters.

### Configuration Page

The **Configuration** page includes three sections:
1. **Module State**: Enables or disables Module A and Module B polling, which also hides the respective page.
2. **Credentials**: Used for Telnet authentication.
3. **Telnet Settings**: Controls the polling state, timer, timeout for a single command, and polling status (idle, processing, failed).

## Notes

The PTF 3207A connector ensures accurate time and frequency outputs by synchronizing with various input signals. Proper configuration of SNMP and Telnet settings is crucial for reliable operation. The flexibility of enabling or disabling modules and adjusting polling settings allows for tailored monitoring and management of the device.
