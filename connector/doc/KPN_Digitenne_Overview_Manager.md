## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

If a **prefix** is defined on the **General** page, all the **Function** **properties** need to have this prefix on the services that need to be monitored (e.g. "DVB Encoding" for an encoding service if the prefix is set to DVB).

The **services** that need to be monitored need to have the **Function**, **Service ID**, and **Stream ID** property. For the services that are located in a transmitter location, the **Location** property needs to be used to provide info on the location.

## How to Use

On the **Streams**, **Services**, and **Locations** pages, you can find the aggregated status based on all the monitored services.

The **Encoding**, **Multiplexing**, **WEAS** **MCC**, **Location** **RX**, and **Location** **TX** pages contain all the monitored services (filled in based on the services found in the system with the appropriate **Function** property).

The **Outage** page contains a table listing all the outages.
