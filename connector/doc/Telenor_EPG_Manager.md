# Telenor EPG Manager

This is a virtual connector that creates **Telenor EPG Channel** **elements for every channel** detected in the Telenor system.

To detect a channel, the connector compares the channels listed in a CSV file and the list of XML TV files contained in a folder. If a channel is listed in the CSV file and a matching XML TV file is present in the folder, an element is created.
