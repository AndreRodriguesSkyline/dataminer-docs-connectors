# Allot Service Gateway Sigma E

The Allot Service Gateway Sigma E connector is used to retrieve network and status data. It analyzes the application, subscriber, device and network topology traffic, is designed for broadband environments and is able to monitor 4G and IPv6-based networks.

## About

The monitoring information is retrieved through SNMP. Polling is based on three SNMP tables from which all data are extracted and interpreted in several custom tables.
