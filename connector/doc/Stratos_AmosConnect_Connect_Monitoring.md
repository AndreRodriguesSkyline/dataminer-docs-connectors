The **Last Hour History** page button, which can be found below the Last Hour Results table, displays the **Last Hour Poll Results** table, which contains the following information for each **Poll Gateway Type** during the last hour, with an interval of 5 minutes: the **Poll Successful Sessions**, **Poll Failed Sessions**, **Poll Total Sessions**, **Poll Success Rate** and **Poll Failure Rate**.
