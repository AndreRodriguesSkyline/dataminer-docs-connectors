# Newtec Dialog Time Series Database - Network Return

This protocol represents a **network** object in the Newtec Dialog Platform.

## About

This connector is automatically generated by the **Newtec Dialog Time Series Database** connector. It is designed to retrieve information related to the network return link.

In the main Newtec dialog element, you can indicate whether a DVE should be created. When DVE creation is enabled, an element with the *Newtec Dialog Time Series Database - Network Return* protocol will be created for each row in the **Network Return TSDB** table of the main element.

For each return technology (HRC, CPM), the return link is divided into one or more return capacity groups.
