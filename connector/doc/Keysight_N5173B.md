## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

Interface connection:

  - **Type of port:** TCP/IP
- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device. Default: *5025.*

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

SCPI commands (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) are used to retrieve the device information. To see the actual traffic between the element and the device, a built-in DataMiner tool called Stream Viewer can be used. You can access it by right-clicking the element in the Surveyor and selecting View \> Stream Viewer.
