# Network Technologies Inc Enviromux-16D

The **Network Technologies Inc Enviromux-16D** connector can be used to monitor critical environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, liquid water presence, power, intrusion and smoke. The connector can also be used to configure the network settings.

The system includes three internal sensors: temperature, humidity and power. It also supports 16 external configurable sensors, 8 digital input sensors, and 4 output relays for the control of external devices.

## About

This connector provides an overview of the internal, external and auxiliary sensors, the digital inputs and the statuses of the output relays, power supplies, etc.

An **SNMP** connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the information of the device.
