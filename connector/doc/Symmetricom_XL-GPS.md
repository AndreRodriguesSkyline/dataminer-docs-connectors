## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection - Main

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161.*
  - **Get community string**: The community string needed to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
  - **Set community string**: The community string needed to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

#### IP Connection - TELNET

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP connection:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination. This will likely be the same as the SNMP IP address.

TCP/IP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port the device is listening on for Telnet requests (default: *23*).
