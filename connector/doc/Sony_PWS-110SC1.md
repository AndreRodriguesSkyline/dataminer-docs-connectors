## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection for Ember+ communication and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default value *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default value *private*.

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

## How to Use - Range 1.0.0.x

### Range 1.0.0.x

The element created using this range of the connector has the following data pages:

- **General**: This page contains general information, such as the **System Description**, **System Up Time**, **System Contact**, **Name**, and **Location**. It also displays an overview of the **OSI Model** of the availability of each layer.
- **Network**: This page displays the **Interfaces** and **Address Translation** tables. The Interfaces table displays the operational status of the interfaces available in the workstation. This operational status can also change based on incoming traps.
- **Product Information**: This page displays the **Product Information**, **Modules**, and **Remote Maintenance** tables. The **Product Information Table** is used to create the DVEs. On this page, you can also find the setting **DVE Automatic Removal**. When this setting is enabled, the connector will take care of the automatic removal of DVEs. When a card is replaced, removed, or switched, for example, the element will delete and create the corresponding DVE respectively, so that the element is always completely in sync with the connected device.
- **Traps**: This page displays the **Traps Destination** table.
- **Alarms**: This page displays the **Error Status** table. This table is cleared when a "Coldstart" trap is received.
- **Configuration**: This page displays the **CTRL1, 2, 3,** and **4** configuration settings and the **SWR1** and **SWR2** configuration settings. Each has a **Status**; this can be enabled or disabled. When a resource is created, these statuses will be taken into consideration. When the status is enabled, the resource will contain this parameter; otherwise, it will not contain this parameter.
- **DVE**: This page displays the **DVE** tables.
- **NMI**: This page allows you to check which NMI element is connected to which slot via the **NMI** table. There is a **Resubscribe** button to reset all the created subscriptions.
- **Tree**: This page allows you to see the entire Ember+ Tree.
