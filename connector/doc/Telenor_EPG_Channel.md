# Telenor EPG Channel

This connector is used to process an XML TV file describing the schedule of a TV channel. It will parse the XML TV file and list the scheduled programs. The connector will also retrieve the same information from an HTTP server and detect any mismatch.

**Telenor EPG Channel** elements are automatically created by a **Telenor EPG Manager** element.
