## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).
- **Device address**: The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

No extra configurations are needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

### General Page

The general page displays a **Channel Status and Configuration** table where the configured system and channels will be displayed, as well as their current status. To configure a new system/channel, go into the **Add New Channel** page, accessible through the page button at the bottom of the general page.

In there, fill in the two required parameters, and press the **Add New Row** button. This will add a new channel configuration to the table.

## Notes

A custom Visio file will be available for this protocol.
