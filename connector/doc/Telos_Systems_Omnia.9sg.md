# Telos Systems Omnia.9sg

The Omnia.9sg is based on the same limiter, clipper, and stereo generator technology incorporated in the Omnia.9 and is ideal for applications where the final limiter and stereo generator must be separate from the main audio processor.

This connector monitors specific Omnia parameters as well as general status parameters via **HTTP**. **SNMP** **traps** can be retrieved when this is enabled on the device.
