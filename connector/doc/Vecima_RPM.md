### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: The bus address of the device (default: *ByPassProxy).*

## How to use

To communicate with the RPM device, fill in the **Username** and **Password** on the main page. Once this is done, information on the RPD cores will be polled and displayed on the **RPD Cores** page.
