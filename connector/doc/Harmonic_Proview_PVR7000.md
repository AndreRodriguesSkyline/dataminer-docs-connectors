## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses an **SNMP** and/or **serial** and/or **HTTP** connection, depending on the version. It requires the following input during element creation:

#### SNMP connection (versions up to 4.2.0.x)

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: the community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

#### Serial connection (no longer available from version 4.2.0.x onwards)

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: 23 (telnet) or 22 (SSH)

#### HTTP connection (available from version 4.1.0.1 onwards)

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*
- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *80*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, by default *bypassproxy*.

## Usage

## Notes

In version 4.0.1.x, a timeout issue can occur where the device responses are not fully received. To solve this, edit the element and change the timeout of a single command (ms) to a higher value, e.g. 30000 instead of the typical 10000.
