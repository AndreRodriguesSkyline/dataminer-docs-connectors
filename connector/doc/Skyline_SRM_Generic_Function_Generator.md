# Skyline SRM Generic Function Generator

This connector can be used to generate resources for an SRM environment. It is intended for use in an environment with one or more matrices. An element will represent a product that is not monitored by DataMiner (an output and input in the matrix). Based on this element, a resource can then be created.
