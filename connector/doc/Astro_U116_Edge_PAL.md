# Astro U116 Edge PAL

Through this connector is possible to gather and view information from the device **Astro U116 Edge PAL**. It also gives the possibility to configure the device.

## About

HTTP connector to monitor the **Astro U116 Edge PAL** device.

This connector also contains an SNMP interface to receive traps from the device and polls some network information.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

### HTTP

This connector can communicate directly to the **U116** but it can also be configured to send the requests to the **Astro U100 Controller** which will then serve as a proxy. Depending on the case, the **HTTP** configuration differs :

A\) Communication with U100C as proxy :

**SERIAL Connection:**

- **IP address/host**: the IP address of the Astro U100 Controller
- **IP port**: the port of the destination e.g. 80
- **Bus address**: The IP address of the U116. Also, we must fill in 'ByPassProxy' to bypass any possible proxy which could block the HTTP communication. Both fields must be separated by a semi-column. e.g : ByPassProxy;10.11.12.13

B\) Direct Communication :

**SERIAL Connection:**

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the U116
- **IP port**: the port of the destination e.g. 80
- **Bus address**: this field can be used to bypass the proxy. To do so fill in the value ByPassProxy.

### SNMP

In either case, the **SNMP** interface collects the traps emitted by the device, so the SNMP IP Address must be the IP Address of the **U116** (not the controller).

**SNMP Connection:**

- **IP Address/host**: The polling IP of the U116, e.g. 10.11.12.13

**SNMP Settings:**

- **Port number**: the port of the connected device, default 161
- **Get community string**: the community string in order to read from the device. The default value is public.
- **Set community string**: the community string in order to set to the device. The default value is private.

## Usage

### General

This page displays some general information about the device.

The credentials of the device must be filled-in behind the **Login** page button.

Some important parameters are available at the end of the first column :

- **Controller Name** : this parameter shows the name of the **Astro Virtual Controller** element which manages this device. If no such element is used, the parameter will show the exception value *No Virtual Controller Found*.

- **Communication Type** :

  - *Direct Communication* : The element sends the requests directly to the Astro module device.
  - *U100C Proxy* : The element sends the requests to the Astro U100 Controller which will forward them to the Astro module. The controller acts as a proxy.

- **Communication Method** : this parameter is only available in *Direct Communication* mode.

  - *Login* : The element logs in to the device before every requests (read and write requests).
  - *Anonymous* : The element logs in to the device only for write requests. The device does not login before read requests.

  ![Download.PNG](~/connector/images/Download.PNG)

  Enter the name of the file then click on `OK'. The file will be saved at this location:

  `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\<protocol name>\<element name>\<file name>`

- To **upload** a file, click *Upload*. The following pop-up window will be displayed:

  ![Upload.PNG](~/connector/images/Upload.PNG)

  **Module Name** lists all the Astro elements of the same type in the system.

  **Upload File Name** lists all the files available in Documents folder of the selected module.

  The file to be uploaded is located at: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\<protocol name>\<element name>\<file name>`

2\. Software Update

The connector allows the user to upload a firmware archive from the local disk of the DMA:

![SoftwareUpdate.PNG](~/connector/images/Astro_U116_Edge_PAL_SoftwareUpdate.PNG)

The **Firmware File** parameter is used to select which file to upload. The dropdown lists all the files present in the DMA hard drive at the location: C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\Protocol Name\>.

Once the file is selected, the user can click the button **Update and Reboot** to start the upgrade. The update progress can be observed in the page behind the **Update Progress** page button. Traps must be configured for that.
