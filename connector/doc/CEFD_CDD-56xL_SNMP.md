# CEFD CDD-56xL SNMP

The CDD-56xL series are integrated IP demodulators that receive two or four independent 70/140 MHz or L-Band channels (depending on model) and combine the output into a single 10/100Base-T Ethernet port for transmission onto the LAN.

## About

This connector is intended to get/set information from/to the device via an Element in a DataMiner System, using SNMP commands.

## Configuration

### Connections

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, default *161*

- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.

- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private.*

## Usage

### Admin

Use this page to configure Mode, Access, Features, SNMP and Decryption related parameters:

- Mode

  - **Working Mode** - To define how the active demodulator is to operate in Vipersat or non-Vipersat Working Mode. Once this unit's role in the network is determined, this single point of configuration simplifies deployment.

- Access

  - **SMTP Server** - Specify the mail server *IP address* from where you want to send the e-mail.
  - **SMTP Domain** - Specify the *domain* of the e-mail server.
  - **SMTP Destination Name** - Specify the e-mail *recipient name*.
  - **Access List** - Use the Access List to grant access via HTTP and SNMP to a defined list of client machines. Select *Enabled* or *Disabled*. If *Disabled*, then any client machine will be able to connect via HTTP and SNMP.
  - **Host Access List** - The Host Access List is used to define which remote clients can connect when the Access List is *Enabled*. Each entry allows a user to specify an *IP address* and a *subnet mask* to define a unique class of machines that are allowed access. For IP 3 / Mask and IP 4 / Mask, make sure they are not *0.0.0.0/0*. An entry with *0.0.0.0/0* simply means any machine is allowed to access.

- Features

  - **Telnet / Ping Relay** - Click *Enabled* or *Disabled* to set either **Telnet** or **Ping Reply** functionality.
  - **Downlink Route All Available Multicast** - Select *Enabled* or *Disabled* to set operation for **Downlink Route All Available Multicast**.
  - **Header Compression** - Select *Enabled* or *Disabled* to set operation for **Header Compression**.

- SNMP

  - **Trap IP Primary / Trap IP Secondary** - Assign the SNMP **Trap IP Primary** and **Trap IP Secondary** addresses.
  - **Trap Version** - Use the drop-down list to set the **Trap Version** as *SNMPv1* or *SNMPv2*.
  - **Trap Community String** - Assign the SNMP **Trap Community String**. The Community String may consist of a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20 alphanumeric characters in length.

- Decryption - *This is accessible only when the 3xDES FAST feature has been purchased and its FAST Access Code has been entered.*

  - **3xDES Decryption**: Receive Keys 1 - 8**: 3xDES keys are used to decrypt traffic being received from the Satellite Interface. Each key is entered in hexadecimal format (48 digits max).

### IP - Ethernet / HDLC

Use this page to view the MAC address and Link Status, and set the IP address/mask, and mode/speed of the IP Module.

- Ethernet

  - **MAC Address (read-only)** - This is set at the factory to a guaranteed unique address that cannot be modified by the user.
  - **Mode & Speed** - Use the drop-down list to select *Auto*, *10 Mbps Half Duplex*, *100 Mbps Half Duplex*, *10 Mbps Full Duplex* or *100 Mbps Full Duplex*.
  - **IP Address/Mask** - The user may enter the *IP Address*/*Mask* for the IP Module Ethernet Interface.

- VLAN Brouter - *In order for this feature to work, Header Compression must be purchased and available.* The VLAN Brouter feature allows VLAN tagged packets to be forwarded when in Brouter mode.

  - **VLAN Brouter Mode** - Use the toggle-button to select this mode as *Enabled* or *Disabled*. Note the following:

    - This mode can be enabled only when one of the Router modes is enabled.
    - When Managed Switch Mode is enabled, this feature is automatically disabled.

  - **VLAN Brouter Next Hop MAC Address** - When VLAN Brouter Mode is *Enabled*, the user may enter the **Next Hop MAC Address**, to which VLAN tagged packets are to be directed, into this text field.

- HDLC - Two IP Module Working Modes are available with Comtech EF Data IP-enabled products: **Managed Switch Mode** (formerly easyConnectTM) and **Router Mode**. For the CDD-56X Satellite Demodulator, three primary HDLC Addressing (Router) Modes are available - *Point-to-Point*, *Small Network*, and *Large Network*. Once the role of a particular CDM-IP Modem is determined in the network, this single point of configuration simplifies deployment. Use this page to specify the Router Mode for the CDM-IP modem/CDD-56X pairing.

  - **HDLC Address Mode** (read-only):

    - *Point-to-Point Mode* - To use in a Point-to-Point SCPC link where there are different IP subnets on either side of the link.
    - *Small Network Mode* - The Small Network Mode supports up to 255 remotes, as allowed using HDLC addressing. When set the unit will be on independent IP subnets; requires adding static routes to pass traffic between them.
    - *Large Network Mode* - This mode is similar to Small Network Mode, the exception being that a maximum of 32,766 remotes are allowed on a single shared satellite outbound carrier.

  - **Receive HDLC Addresses (Hex)** - The address may be assigned on a per-demod basis within the following ranges:

    - Point-to-Point - *No HDLC address -Not Defined*
    - Small Network - *0x1* to *0xFE*
    - Large Network - *0x1* to *0xFFFE*

### IP - Routes / IGMP

Use this page to enter static routes into the IP Module on a *per-demod* basis, for the purpose of routing IP traffic over the satellite or to another device on the local LAN and to manage multicast IP traffic over the satellite or to another device on the local LAN.

- **Routes/Multicast Table:** The current entries present in Route Table. To delete a route use the **Route Row Status** column option, *Delete*.

  - **Route Table Entry:**

    - **Name** - Assign a label for the Route Entry as a means to maintain the network. The assigned name cannot contain any whitespace and must be unique.

    - **IP Address/Mask** - This address defines the route to the destination network.

    - **Next Hop Address** - When the route is of type **Sat to Eth**, use the **Next Hop Address** to define the locally attached router's IP address that will be used to route to the destination network. This is the case when there is another subnet addressed to the modem on the LAN side. The address may be assigned, dependent on the selected Working Mode, within the following ranges:

      - *Point-to-Point* - No HDLC address
      - *Small Network* - 0x1 to 0xFE
      - *Large Network* - 0x1 to 0xFFFE

    - **Sat to Eth** - Select the valid packet handling value for routing to a destination network, using the drop-down list:

      - *Forward* - Multicast is only forwarded across link if both units have this feature enabled.
      - *Filter* - A multicast packet is received but there is no application associated with it.

- Demod as Server - Use this page to facilitate the use of IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) with configured multicast routes.

  - **Enable IGMP** - Use the toggle-button to select *Enabled* or *Disabled*. If enabled, the IP Module responds to IGMP queries for the configured multicast routes on the transmit side and generates IGMP queries on the receive side.

  - **IGMP Query Period** - Enter a query period value - from *1* to *600* seconds - into the text box.

  - **IGMP Maximum Response Time** - Enter a response time value that is less than the IGMPQuery Period minus one - from *1* to *598* seconds - into the text box.

  - **Missed Responses Before Leaving IGMP Group** - Enter the number of desired missed responses - from *1* to *30*  - into the text box.

  - **IGMP Table** - This *read-only* table lists the IGMP Groups that are active on the demodulator. This includes the **TTL** (Time to Live) for the entry; the **Client State** (Idle, Active, or Closing); and the **SRC** and **Group Entries**.

  - **Restore** - Uses the internal, hard-coded factory default parameters.

- Save/Reboot

  - **Save** - Causes all configuration changes made during this operational session to the demodulator and IP parameters to be stored to Flash memory. These updates are permanent until the user either initiates and saves a new round of settings updates, or restores all settings to the original factory defaults. Any changes made to the demodulators will be lost upon reset or power loss unless the changes are saved to permanent storage. This applies to all of the demodulator and IP parameters.
