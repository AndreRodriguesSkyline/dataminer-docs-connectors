## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *502*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Range: *0-7*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This module is typically mounted in a 4- or 8-slot ADAM-5000 rack module and the bus address is determined by the slot position.

## How to use

This connector has only one data page, which allows you to monitor the **Real State** of each of the 6 channels.
