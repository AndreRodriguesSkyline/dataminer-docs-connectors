# CEFD NetVue Remote Gateway

The CEFD NetVue Remote Gateway is a virtual connector that displays information about a remote device belonging to the NetVue system.

The connector does not do any polling: the data displayed by the connector is pushed by the **CEFD NetVue HUB Gateway** element managing this remote.

The remote gateway elements are created automatically by the **CEFD NetVue Manager** element and must not be created manually.
