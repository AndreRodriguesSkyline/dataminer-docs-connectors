# Snell Wilcox IQUDC30

The **Snell Wilcox IQUDC30** connector monitors and configures the IQUDC30 converter.

## About

The connector polls all parameters once after startup. After this, parameter updates depend on event messages generated by the device when a parameter changes. However, it is possible to manually trigger the polling of all parameters with the **Force Poll** button on the General page.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a single smart-serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *2050*.
  - **Bus Address**: The bus of the card on the chassis. The default value is *UU.PP (Hex)*. This shows the expected structure of the address, where *UU* is the chassis ID, and the *PP* is the card position, both in hex.

## Usage
