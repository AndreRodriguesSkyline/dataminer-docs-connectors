## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *161*).

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

This connector allows you to monitor and configure system information.

It is also possible to **configure the polling** for specific sections for the modulator and demodulator.

For the **modulator**, you can check information such as Mode, Transmit, Transmit State, Output Frequency, Output Band, Roll-off, Occupied Bandwidth, Spectrum Polarity, Output Level, Clock Output, Carrier Modulation, and Amplifier Slope Equalizer.

For the **demodulator**, you can find information for Mode, Input Frequency, Symbol Rate, Roll-off, Input Selection, LNB Power Supply, Spectral Inversion, Carrier Input Level, EsNo, MOD COD, L-Band Input Level, Frame Counter, Errored Frame Counter, Link Margin Est, C/D Est, and Channel Quality Est.

Information about traffic shaping, remote terminals, ACM, BBF, redundancy, and GSE is also displayed.

Finally, the element will also show **active and historic alarm information**.
