# Snell Wilcox IQUPC00

The **Snell Wilcox IQUPC00** connector monitors and controls changes on the up-converter unit through a **Rollcall** **smart-serial** protocol. The card is used in the **IQ Modular Chassis**.

## About

The connector periodically polls relevant information from the device. This happens every 15 seconds for Rollcall protocol purposes and every two hours for backchannel purposes.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device, by default *2050*.
  - **Bus address**: The bus of the card on the chassis. The default, *UU.PP (Hex)*, shows the expected structure of the address, where UU is the chassis ID, and the PP is the card position, both in Hex.

## Usage

### Audio - Routing Output Embed

This page contains the configuration for the **Audio** **Output Routing**, the **Output Routing Options** and the **Audio** **Output Destination**. It also displays the **Output Routing Status**.

### Audio - Setup

This page allows you to configure the **Audio Bus Delays** on several levels, the **Test Tones**, the **Audio Levels** and the **Remote RollTrack Sources**.

It also displays the **Total Pair Delay** for each of the eight buses and allows you to configure the delays in a more **Coarse** or **Fine** way.

### Audio - Mixer

This page allows you to **select the mixer** in use, configure the **LoRo** part of the mixer, and configure each of the six **Mixer Sources**, including the **Source**, **ProcGain**, **Invert** and **Mute**.

### Audio - Output Embed

On this page, you can configure the **Default ProcAmp**, as well as the eight output **Embed** channels, including the **ProcAmp**, **Mute**, **Stereo** and **Dolby Line**.

You can also configure the **Embed Groups**, which join each of the followed outputs into a single unit. This means that there are four groups:

- Embed 1+2
- Embed 3+4
- Embed 5+6
- Embed 7+8

### Loud Monitoring

### System - Memories

The page displays the configurable **User Memory** setting slots **1 to 16** of the device.

You can recall the settings from any of the previous slots with the **Recall Memory** option and check the last used memory setting slot in the **Last User Memory**.

To save a memory setting, first use the **Select Memory** parameter to either select one of the memory slots or select *None*, configure the name using the **Change Memory Name** parameter (which will be displayed for the corresponding **Memory Name Values** parameter), and select whether to **Save** or **Clear** the memory. Note that when you clear the memory, the configuration associated with it will be lost, and you will need to save it again later in order to re-create it.
