# Skyline ICMP Platform Manager

This connector is part of a generic solution that monitors the connection health of several ICMP-capable devices via ping and aggregates the results to provide an overview at different levels.

The Skyline ICMP Platform Manager element can be configured in two ways:

- **Front end:** The front-end element acts as the main entry point to the solution. It will gather all information from the back end and the collector elements to calculate the KPI. Only one front-end element should be created for the solution.

- **Back end:** A back-end element is responsible for the aggregation of the data from the collector elements. It is possible to have more than one back-end element integrated in the system. We suggest that you create one per DMA.

Different search **topologies** are presented in the Skyline ICMP Platform Manager. These topologies are diagrams shown in Visual Overview that describe the logical connections between the entities of the infrastructure. The current implementation integrates the following topologies: **Location**, **State**, **Model**, **Station,** and **Quick**. Each topology represents a connected entity from top to bottom. The following chains are present:

- **Location:**

  - Super-Region
  - Sub-Region
  - State
  - City
  - Device

- **State:**

  - State
  - Device

- **Model:**

  - Model
  - Device

- **Station:**

  - Station
  - Device

- **Quick:** This allows you to quickly access the topology level by selecting the desired filter (Super-Region, Sub-Region, State, City, Model, Station, Device).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

To configure the entire system properly, as a **DataMiner** **System Administrator**, you should follow these steps:

1. Create a front-end Skyline ICMP Platform Manager element by setting the parameter **Element Manager Type** to *Front-End* on the **Configuration** page.

1. Create one or more back-end Skyline ICMP Platform Manager elements by setting this same parameter to *Back-End* on their **Configuration** page.

1. Create a **Collector** element.

1. Define the **File Import and Export Path** on the **Configuration** page. If you change the default path, keep in mind that the same configuration needs to be executed on all the ICMP elements in the system.

   - If the **File Import Path** or **File Export Path** is in a remote location, fill in the **Username** and **Password** fields in the System Credentials section of the **Configuration** page.

1. Register the **Collector** element (DMA ID/element ID) in the **Collector Registration** table on the Front-End or Back-End page.

1. If you are configuring the front end, register the back end (DMA ID/element ID) in the **FE-BE Registration** table; otherwise register the front end.

1. In the location specified in the File Import Path parameter earlier, provide a CSV file (separated by ";") with the format illustrated below.

   **If the folder defined in the parameter does not exist, you will need to create it**.

   Note that headers must be capitalized, and the file name should follow the format **DMAID_ElementID_ICMP**.

   The relation in the CSV file between topology levels must be One-to-Many from up to down and One-to-One from down to up. Levels from up to down: **Super-Region, Sub-Region, State, Station, Model,** and **Device.**

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

When the initialization steps have been completed, go to the **Configuration** page of the **front-end** element, and click the **Import** button to load the information of the provided CSV file. This action will create a CSV file with the IDs for every entry to be read by the back-end element and a **Device_Config.json** file with those generated IDs.

Then click the **Import** button in the **back-end** element to generate the CSV file that the collector needs to fill all its tables.
