# iDirect Platform Virtual

This protocol represents a **terminal** (customer installation) object in an iDirect NMS platform.

## About

This connector is automatically generated by connector **iDirect Platform**.

In the main iDirect Platform element, you can indicate whether a DVE must be created. When DVE creation is enabled, an element with the iDirect Platform Virtual protocol will be created for each row in the **iDirect Platform Table** of the main element.

Different possibilities for **alarm monitoring** and **trending** are available.

When the remote is deactivated or removed from the iDirect NMS, the **Delete Element** button can be used to also delete the DVE in DataMiner. This is only applicable when the **Auto Delete Remote DVEs** parameter is disabled in the main element.

### Alarms page

This page displays all alarm information.

### Remote Status page

This page contains real-time information such as the **SNR**, **power**, **temperature**, **gain, CRC and SCPC errors**, etc.

### Traffic Statistics page

This page displays **traffic rates** for TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, HTTP and other data. Totals are available for a fixed window (daily, weekly, monthly or custom, reset at the beginning of each period) and a sliding window (last 7 days and last 30 days).

#### Custom Traffic Counters subpage
