# Infoblox NIOS Platform

Network Identity Operating System (NIOS) is the operating system that powers Infoblox core network services, to ensure the operation of network infrastructures.Next The NIOS platform automates the deployment and management of  network services such as DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (IPAM).

The Infoblox NIOS Platform Connector enables the retrieval of important key performance indicators (KPIs) from the NIOS Platform via its API. These KPIs provide insights into the health and status of the deployed network infrastructure, including metrics such as  power supply levels, memory usage and the status of services.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

  - **IP address/host**: [The polling IP or URL of the destination.]
  - **IP port**: [The IP port of the destination. (default: *443*)]
  - **Device address**: [The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.]

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: [The polling IP or URL of the destination.]
- **IP port**: [The IP port of the destination.]


SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: [The community string used when reading values from the device. (default: *public*)]
- **Set community string**: [The community string used when setting values on the device. (default: *private*)]


### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The Infoblox NIOS Platform connector uses both SNMP and HTTP connections to gather data. The SNMP connection retrieves basic information about the platform, including the hardware version, serial number, and NIOS version.

The HTTP connection provides access to important KPIs related to networks, members, and nodes, such as high availability status and utilization metrics.

Moreover, the connector allows users to verify license validity for the platform.
