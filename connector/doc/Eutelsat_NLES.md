# Eutelsat NLES

This connector is used to send a serial message to the **NLES station**. To compose the message, the connector retrieves KPIs from the Eutelsat DMS and computes status parameters. Those status parameters are concatenated to form the serial message.

The message is sent every 10 minutes as well as every time a KPI change is detected.
