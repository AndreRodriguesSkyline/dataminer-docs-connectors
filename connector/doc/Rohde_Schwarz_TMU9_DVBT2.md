# Rohde Schwarz TMU9 DVBT2

The R&S TMU9 DVBT2 is a compact-size, efficient and reliable transmitter with different possible standard configurations. Power consumption ranges from 300 W to 3.0 kW for digital standards, going up to 4.75 kW for analog standards. With an efficiency of up to 30 % in normal mode, it both saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions. Built-in bandpass filters ensure short delivery times and innovative configurations, such as MultiTX or N+1 systems in a single rack.

This **SNMP** connector is used to monitor and configure the **Rohde Schwarz TMU9 DVBT2** transmitter.

## About

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.
