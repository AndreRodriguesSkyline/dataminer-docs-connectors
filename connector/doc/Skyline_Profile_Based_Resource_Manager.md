# Skyline Profile Based Resource Manager

The purpose of this connector is to generate one-on-one **function resources** based on **profile instances**.

Via this way it is possible to use **resources** that are pre-configured based on the **profile instance** data, across different **service definitions**.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

A function.xml must be assigned to this connector. Each function will be linked to a **Profile Definition** existing on the system.
For a correct working it is required to create one element per desired function.

In the element, select the required **function** type to which the resource should be linked. This will act as a filter and search on the **DataMiner System** for linked **Profile Instances**.
For each **Profile Instance** a **Resource** can be created based on the settings in the Config page.
By default a sync with the system data is minute and the auto generation is disabled.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

The **General** page provides on overview of the properties the resource should use.
Via the **Function Type** you can select one of the available functions linked to the connector. For example: *Satellite Channel*
It will act as a filter to search all existing **Profile Instances** linked to the functions **Profile Definition**. The result of this search is shown in the table.

The **Resource Pool** and **Resource Concurrency** are used to indicate where the resource must be stored (the pool) and how many times the resource can be used at the same time.

From a resource point of view it is useful to know to what profile instance it is linked. For this purpose it is possible to select a **Profile Capability.** This reflects the Profile Instance Parameter that will be used to store the name of the profile instance name in.

### Creating resources

This can be done in different ways.

- A manual action by pressing the create button per profile instance, this will create/update the resource for the selected profile instance.
- A manual action by pressing the sync now button in the config page, this will create/update all the resources.
- Automatically by enabling the Auto Update in the config page, this will create/update all the resources as soon as there is a change.

The resource will be created/updated when:

- Linked profile instance name is changed
- Resource pool is changed
- Resource concurrency is changed
- Profile Capability is changed

The resource will be removed when the profile instance is removed.
Note that this will only occur when the *Sync Now* button was pressed or the **Auto update** is enabled.
