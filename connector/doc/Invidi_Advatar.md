## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: The device address.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: public).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: private).

## How to Use

The element consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Provides a status overview of the connected interfaces. Each status parameter can have the value *Ok*, *Not-Applicable*, *Warning* or *Error*.
- **BDMS Statistics**: Contains information about the communications across the SOAP interface between the Business Data Management System (BDMS) and Advatar Adapter.
- **Cue Tones Statistics**: Lists the cue tones delivered on the network stream and processed through Advatar.
- **Discarded**: Lists the break windows not processed by the Advatar Adapter to create view lists/break descriptors.
- **Service Mux**: Lists the muxes communicating with the BDS, along with the services advertised by each of them.
- **SCTE35 Connection**: Displays the status of the connection to the SCTE35 receivers configured in the system.
- **Cue Connection Statistics**: Displays a statistics table for the received cues.
- **In-band Connection Statistics**: Displays a statistics table for in-band data (i.e. cues/view list/break descriptor/vote now) sent to the set-top boxes.
- **BDS Errors**: Lists the problems encountered by viewers, which may or may not affect operations.
- **Trap Table**: Lists the traps received from the device. An automatic cleanup mechanism is available that prevents endlessly growing tables.
