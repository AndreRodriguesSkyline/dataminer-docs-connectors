# SEE Telecom Acsys PS

This protocol allows you to monitor the SEE Telecom Acsys PS receiver. It uses an SNMP connection to poll the parameters found in the device.

The protocol uses two different timers: The fast timer group retrieves the most important parameters every 30 seconds, while the slow timer polls the remaining parameters every hour.
