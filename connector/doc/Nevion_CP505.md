The advanced model offers the basic features plus PID and program filtering with ATSC PSIP and DVB SI processing capabilities.

## About

This connector uses an **HTTP** connection to get and set information on the device. The commands sent are based on its own communication protocol, the **TXP - T-VIPS XML Protocol**.

The layout of the connector mirrors the device's web interface as much as possible. For more information, refer to: <http://nevion.com/products/processingmultiplexing/cp505>.
