# Peak Communications TLTH

The TLTH(B) series of test loop translators are designed to take a sample of the transmit signal and convert it to a  frequency at which it can be monitored or analyzed. 
Often monitoring of the transmit signal is required at L-Band, or alternatively a translation of the transmit signal to the receive band which is then applied to the receive equipment in a test mode.
