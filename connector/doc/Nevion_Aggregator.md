## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

This connector only contains one page, the General page, which displays the **TSoIP SIPS and Buffer Summary**, **Element Configuration**, and **Elements** tables.

The **Element Configuration** table displays all Nevion NX4600 elements, with an **Add Element** button that can be used to add the current row's EID/DMAID to the **Elements** table. After you click the **Add Element Keys** button, that element will be included in the SIPS table.

There is also a **Refresh Elements** button, for elements that have been added since the connector started up. A restart of the element also will cause a refresh.

To add an element:

- Click **Add Element** for the element you want to add in the **Element Configuration** table.
- Click **Add Element Keys** for the newly added element in the **Elements** table.
