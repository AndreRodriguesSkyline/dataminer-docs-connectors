# Miranda Imagestore 750

This is a multi-image processor connector with SNMP and serial interfaces.

The connector is used to monitor the audio and video input and to set the transition and fade duration of a stream. After a user presses a button, the configuration is implemented by means of serial commands.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. The default value is *private*.

#### Serial connection 1

This connector also uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SERIAL Settings:

- **Type of Port**: UDP/IP.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.

## Usage

### General Parameters

This page contains information about the device: the System Name, System Location, System Description, System UpTime and System Contact Person.

On the right side of the page, you can find **Imagestore Info** parameters (Software Version, Serial Number, Disk Usage Status and Disk Usage Percentage), as well as the page buttons **Health** and **Network Interface**. The **Health** page button displays information related to the Temperature, Fan, Voltage and Power Supply.

### Input

This page contains three tables, **Video Input**, **Embedded Audio**, and **AES Audio**. Below this, **External Reference** values are displayed.

### GPIO

This page displays the status and direction for all fifteen entries.

### Video/Audio

This page displays the **Fade To Black Angle** and the **Fade To Silent Angle.**

### Transitions and Audio

This page allows you to set the **Transition Duration** (Layer, Type and Rate) and **Fade Transition** (Layer, Fade Type and Fade Rate).

### Audio/Image/Fade Setup

This page allows you to set an audio file in a layer and then play it or stop playing it. You can also load an image to a layer and select the fade. The **Arm**, **Disarm**, and **Take** actions for the Fade Keyer Up/Down commands are also implemented.

When executing the Disarm Fade Keyer action, you need to specify the Arm/Disarm Layer. The connector will automatically check the keyer direction that is currently armed and apply the disarm (if there is an Armed Keyer).

The **Disarm All** button will disarm all currently armed commands on the Imagestore.

### Input Mode

This page allows you to change between SDI and Black.

### Load Shuffle Preset

This page loads a named shuffle preset into a shuffle block associated with a specific input stream, voiceover, or output, to change the crosspoints in bulk.

### Default Settings

This page allows you to set up predefined actions and combinations of actions using an interface.

### Web Interface

This page shows the web page of the device. The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## DCF Implementation

The inputs are retrieved from the video table and connected to the program output. All the connections are static and can only be disconnect or connected.

## Notes

From version 1.0.2.20 onwards, the connector can prevent a potential problem where rebooting causes the device to freeze. To enable this feature, set the parameter **Reboot Precaution** to *Enabled*. You can set a delay to start up the serial connection. You will need to adapt the connection setting as well.

This is an example of what this should look like:
