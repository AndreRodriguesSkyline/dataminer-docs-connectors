## How to use

As this is a virtual connector, **no data traffic** will be shown **in the Stream Viewer**.

There are two workflows to exchange data between the Verizon Reports and Dashboards Solution connector and the Profile Manager app:

- **OnUpdate**: Used to retrieve data from the Profile Manager and update tables in the Verizon Reports and Dashboards Solution.
- **OnChange**: Used to add/remove/edit entries in the Profile Manager.

A workflow is triggered by an action in the Verizon Reports and Dashboards Solution connector. It generates a sequence of actions (information event \> Correlation rule \> Automation script) that results in an update or change of data. For an update event, the connector will get the relevant data from the Profile Manager and update the corresponding tables. For a change event, the connector will add, edit or remove the relevant data from the Profile Manager depending on the executed action.
