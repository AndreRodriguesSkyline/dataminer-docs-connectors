## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to retrieve traps. It does not use any SNMP polling. It requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP or URL of the ESB Bus.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the ESB Bus.

## How to use

The General page displays all the information collected by the connector. You can find this information in the **KPI Table**. This table results from the parsing of the received traps. Each row contains information regarding a specific KPI, such as **Application Name**, **Module Name,** **Application Criticity**, **Value**, **Importance**, **Broadcast Type** and **Status**.
