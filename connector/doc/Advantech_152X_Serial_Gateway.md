# Advantech 152X Serial Gateway

The EKI-152X models are industrial-grade network-based serial device servers that allow you to connect up to 8 or 16 serial RS-232/422/485 devices, such as CNCs, PLCs, scales, and scanners, directly to a TCP/IP network. The EKI-152X models feature two independent Ethernet ports and MAC addresses to provide a redundant network mechanism, guaranteeing Ethernet network reliability. The models can be configured via Windows utility, web browser, serial console, or Telnet console, so that it is easy to manage many EKI-152X or serial devices in your network.
