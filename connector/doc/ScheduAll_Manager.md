# ScheduAll Manager

ScheduAll is an application running on Windows OS that manages bookings (a.k.a. work orders) and resources.

## About

This connector allows communication to and from ScheduAll via a web service API and/or via an interop chorus API.

The **web service** API is an XML interface over HTTP. DataMiner can send requests and receives responses accordingly. The interop chorus API works in a different way. Via **interop**, ScheduAll sends data in a specific format to DataMiner without getting a request first (i.e. eventing). The structure of this message is defined via message templates in ScheduAll.

## Usage (range 2.0.0.x / 2.0.1.x)

### General

This page indicates the **ScheduAll** **status** for both: **Web Service** and the **Interop Services.**

### Configuration

This page contains **basic configuration** parameters for both the web and the interop services. It is among others possible to **enable or disable** either of the two services here.

This page includes both the **Task Configuration** and the **Message Fields Configuration**.

The task configuration is used to launch an Automation script when new bookings (or updates) are retrieved.

### Configuration - Web Service

This page contains **communication configuration** parameters related to the web service. This includes the following settings:

- Disabling or enabling the communication with the web service.
- Adjusting the polling time with the **Communication Web Service Polling Time** parameter.
- Disabling or enabling polling of the client info or resource info tables from ScheduAll.
- Time format used by ScheduAll.

#### Timespan configuration

With a start and stop parameter, the size of a sliding window can be defined (in minutes) in which data (bookings + resources) have to be retrieved. For example, if you configure a start of -1440 min and a stop of 1440 min, DataMiner is going to retrieve all bookings that have a start or stop time 24 hours before and 24 hours after the current time.

#### Query Configuration

If not all bookings have to be retrieved from ScheduAll but only a subset, this section can be used for defining a filter. There are two filters available:

- **Work Order Query Resource Filter**: Only bookings that contain one of the resources defined in this filter will be retrieved.
- **Work Order Query Resource Group Filter**: Only bookings that contain resources that are in the resource group defined in this filter will be retrieved. Note that in order for this to work, the polling of the 'Resource Information' table has to be enabled.

The **Message field configuration** allows you to define which data fields from ScheduAll have to be retrieved:

- **Work Order Custom Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the work order table in ScheduAll. Per work order, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the "Custom WO Fields" column in the "Work Order Overview" table.
- **Query Custom WO USER Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the WO_USER table in ScheduAll. Per work order, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the "Custom WO USER Fields" column in the 'Work Order Overview" table.
- **Resource Custom Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the booking resource table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are stored in the "RES Custom xx" columns in the "Resource Overview" table.
- **Query Custom SEVT EX Fields**: Here you can define which additional fields have to be retrieved on top of the default ones from the SEVT_EX table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the "Custom SEVT EX Fields" column in the "Resource Overview" table.
- **Query Custom Resource Details Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the Resource Details table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the "Custom Resource Details Fields" column in the "Resource Overview" table.
- **Query Custom Client Details Fields**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the client table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are JSON-encoded and stored in the "Custom Client Details Fields" column in the "Client Overview" table.
- **Query Custom Values**: Here you can define which fields have to be retrieved in addition to the default fields from the resource info table in ScheduAll. Per resource, the values are stored in the "Custom x" columns in the "Resource Information" table.



### Configuration - Interop Service

This page contains the **interop-specific configuration** parameters. Via the **Credentials** button, you can access a subpage where you can enter **user credentials**. These credentials are the **ScheduAll credentials** that will allow communication between DataMiner and the interop service.

### Configuration - Parameter Mapping

This page contains a table of **Parameter Mapping Names.** Via the right-click menu, you can add extra mapping lines to this table. This table can be used by Automation scripts to map field names from ScheduAll with field names in DataMiner.

### Work Order Overview

This page contains a table of current **work order information**. This table contains an overview of all the information related to the present work orders, and provides the possibility to delete a specific work order.
Note that this page also displays the current **resources scheduled** by ScheduAll.

### Category Overview

This page contains two tables. The table on the left lists all **Category Names**, while the table on the right contains **Category Type** information.

### Client Overview

This page contains a table of **Client Names**.

### Statistics - Web Service

This page contains **web service statistics** for current **queries** and **work orders**.

### Statistics - Interop Service

On this page, a single parameter displays the **Interop Received Time**. In addition, there is a button linking to the **Interop Listener**. The interop listener provides information on the responses DataMiner receives from the interop service.



## Usage (range 2.0.3.x)

### General

This page indicates the **ScheduAll** **status** for both: **Web Service** and the **Interop Services.**

### Configuration

This page contains **Communication Configuration** parameters for both the **Web Service** and the **Interop Services**, where it's possible to **enable** or **disable** the referred services.
Moreover, this page also includes the **Task Configuration,** which allows the user to define the validation of the **Work Orders** content as well as the the data used to launch the configured **Automation Script** when new or modified **Work Orders** are retrieved.

### Configuration \[Sub-Page: Task Automation Script\]

This page contains the configuration of the **Automation Script** defined in the **Task Automation Script Name** under the **Configuration** page, where it's possible to specify the following settings:

- **Startup Trigger:** Defines whether the Automation Script is triggered at Connector Startup (Enabled) or not (Disabled).


- **Default Behavior:** Defines whether the Default Behavior is Enabled or Disabled:

- **Enabled:** The Task Automation Script will be triggered with the default Input Script Parameter: \[ "Work Order ID": WO ID \[IDX\] \]. Note that the referred Input Script Parameter in case of a 'Bulk' Processing State the will have a serialized list of 'WO ID \[IDX\]'.

  - **Disabled:** The Task Automation Script will be triggered according to the data present in the Input Script Parameters table.

    >

- **Processing State:** Defines whether the Task Automation Script processing is Single or Bulk:

- **Single:** The Task Automation Script will be triggered individually for each new/modified Work Order.
  - **Bulk:** The Task Automation Script will be triggered once, receiving as input argument a serialized list of new or modified Work Orders information according to the current configuration of the Input Script Parameters table.


- **Pending Script Processing Buffer:** Defines whether there's a buffer holding the pending Work Orders to be passed as Input Script Parameter (Enabled) or not (Disabled):

- **Enabled:** A buffer will be used to hold the Work Orders that would be passsed as Input Parameter of the 'Task Automation Script' if the Script is still processing those same Work Orders.
    (e.g. If there's a running Script busy processing '#WO12345', that Work Order will be stored in the referred buffer).

    Note: If this option is selected, the 'Task Auatomation Script' will be responsible for triggering the Script again in order to process the pending Work Orders that were added,
    which can be done throught a set of the pending Work Order IDs (separated by ;) in the 'Work Order IDs Pending Script Processing (ID=35)'. (e.g. The Work Order IDs should be set with the following format: '12345;123456;123457').
  - **Disabled:** The Task Automation Script will be triggered once, receiving as input argument a serialized list of new or modified Work Orders information according to the current configuration of the Input Script Parameters table.

In this page it's possible to define the **Input Script Parameters,** which are passed as an argument of the referred **Automation Script** for either **new or modified Work Orders:**

- **\[Full WO w/ Resources in JSON\]:** JSON containing new or modified Work Order(s) alongside with their associated Resource(s).
- **\[Full WO wo/ Resources in JSON\]:** JSON containing new or modified Work Order(s).
- **SEQNUM \[WO ID\]:** ID of the new or modified Work Order(s).
- **JOBDESC \[WO Description\]:** Clip Name of the new or modified Work Order(s).
- **WO_START \[WO Start Time\]:** Start time of the new or modified Work Orders(s).
- **WO_END \[WO End Time\]:** End time of the new or modified Work Orders(s).
- **STAT \[WO DMS Task State\]:** Mirrors Work Order(s) Status, which are mapped to the DataMiner Booking Status through the **Task Status Definition** Sub-Page.
- **STATUSEX \[WO DMS Task State Extended\]:** Mirrors Work Order(s) Extended Status, which are mapped to the DataMiner Booking Status through the **Task Status Definition** Sub-Page.
- **STAT.STATUSEX \[WO Status\]:** Combined Work Order(s) Status, as defined in the **Task Status Definition** Sub-Page.
- **WONUM \[WO Number\]:** Number of the Work Order(s).
- **CREATEDBY \[WO Created By\]:** User that has created the Work Order(s).
- **DATECREAT \[WO Date Created\]:** Creation date of the Work Order(s).
- **MOD_BY \[WO Modified By\]:** Last user that has modified the Work Order(s).
- **LAST_MOD \[WO Last Modified\]:** Last modified date of the Work Order(s).
- **CL_ID \[WO Client ID\]:** Client record(s), which can either identify an Agency or a Contact.

In addition, it's also possible to configure in this page which **Work Order Status Transitions** will trigger the referred Automation Script. Note that if no transition is defined, the Automation Script will be triggered for each Work Order Status change.

- **Previous Status:** Defines the previous Work Order status for the each configured transition.
- **Current Status:** Defines the current Work Order status for the each configured transition.
- **Valid Status for New Work Order(s):** Defines which status are valid to trigger the Automation Script for new Work Orders. Note that this table column is independent from the other columns and is only applied to new Work Orders.


### Configuration \[Sub-Page: Task Status Definition\]

This page defines the mapping between the **STAT** and **STATUSEX ScheduAll** fields and the corresponding **Booking Status** in DataMiner, either for the **Web Service** as well as for the **Interop Services**.
