# Connector documentation template

The AUC28 Wideband Series Converter is a high performance, low cost and reliable RF indoor subsystem which is designed to provide the function of 
frequency conversion of 70MHz/140MHz (±18MHz) or 140MHz (±36MHz) IF signals to the L-Band signals (950 – 2150) MHz or (950 – 1850) MHz on the transmit 
side and convert the L-Band signals (950 – 2150) MHz or (950 – 1850) MHz to 70MHz/140MHz (±18MHz) or 140MHz (±36MHz) IF signals on the receive side.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Direct connection:

  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device, in this case 9600.
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device, default value 8.
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device, default value 1.
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device, default value No.

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

## How to use

There are four pages presented in the driver where you can monitor or configure the parameters to the device. 
General page contains information about AUC, BUC, Alarms and other general parameters related to the device.
Voltage and Temperature page contains information about current voltage and temperature of output and SSPA. Enables users to set SSPA temperature.
Equipment Status page shows all information available on the equipment.
Frequency and Attenuation page contains current information on temperature and attenuation and allows users to set uplink and downlink frequency and attenuation.

### Interfaces

This page provides all the information about available interfaces.

## Notes
