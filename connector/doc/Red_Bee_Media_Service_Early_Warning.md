# Red Bee Media Service Early Warning

The purpose of this connector is to list service warnings and indicate at which point in time they will have a critical impact if no action is taken.

The warnings are collected via an Automation script. The user has the option to trigger the script manually or let the script be executed at a specified time interval.
