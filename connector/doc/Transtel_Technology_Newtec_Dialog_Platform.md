## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP of the Newtec DMA.
- **IP port**: 80
- **Device address**: BypassProxy

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection, for which no input is required during element creation.

### Initialization

This connector is designed to poll one DMA. In case of a cluster consisting of multiple DMAs, one element will be needed for each DMA in the cluster.

To set up the element, you need to specify the DMA ID of the Agent you want to poll and the credentials.

On the **Polling Config** page, you can enable what should be polled. Once this has been configured, the element should start retrieving info from the DMA.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

This connector retrieves all the **elements** and **protocols** on the specified DMA, as well as particular **tables** and **parameters** from elements, and displays these.

It is possible to create DVEs for some of these DataMiner elements. These can be enabled in the exported protocol overview table.
