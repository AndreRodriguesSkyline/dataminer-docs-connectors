# SES S.A. TEMOS

TEMOS is a system at SES S.A. that is able to retrieve satellite telemetry data from a server named TLMCore. The TLMCore is a socket server that handles XML requests. This connector allows users to view the telemetry data in a table of channels.

## About

Depending on the version, this connector functions in a very different way:

- Version **1.0.0.x** of the connector uses a **serial** connection to obtain the telemetry data from the TLMCore server.
- Version **1.0.1.x** of the connector uses a **virtual** connection to display satellite telemetry data. The connector obtains the data by creating an **SES S.A. TEMOS Probe** element per satellite to retrieve the information from the TLMCore server.

- *Fast*: This option indicates that all the parameters will be polled every 5 seconds.
- *Inactive*: The tube will not be polled.

> [!NOTE]
> Slow is the default option.

### Satellite Connections

## Usage [1.0.1.x]

### Channel

This page displays the **Channel Table**, which shows the data from the uploaded **Channel CSV** file and the telemetry data of each channel.

The **Channel CSV** file is loaded automatically after the LRV file has been loaded (See "LRV" section below). The Channel CSV file should be placed in the following web location: <https://lamp.dino.astra.ses/bro-tools/chlist/start.php?page=dataminer-channel-list>. The file is loaded automatically every 10 minutes in case there are changes. The **Import Channel File** button allows you to update the file manually. For more information on the configuration of the file, refer to the "Notes" section below.

Via the **Configuration** subpage of the Channels page, you can configure the **User** and **Password** that will be used to access the **Channel CSV** file in the web location. This web location can also be edited on this subpage. In addition, the **IP address** and **Port** that will be used when creating the Probe elements can also be edited on this subpage.

### LRV

On this page, you can select the **LRV CSV** file that must be uploaded to the element. To do so, select the file from the **LRV File** drop-down list and press the button **Import** **LRV File**. This file must be located in the following folder: "*C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\SES S.A. TEMOS\LRVs\\*". For more information on the configuration of the file, refer to the "Notes" section below.

This page contains the **LRV Table**, which displays all the data from the LRV file that was uploaded. You can import and export the table in CSV format and add or delete a row in this table.

### Tube Configuration

This page contains the **Tube Configuration Table**, which allows you to select when the telemetry data of each tube should be requested.

In the **Polling** column of the table, you can select one of the following options:

- *Inactive*: The tube will not be polled.

> [!NOTE]
> Slow is the default option.

### Satellite Information

This page displays the **Satellite Information Table**. This table contains information related to the **SES S.A. Probe** elements that where created by the connector.

The table contains the following columns:

- **Satellite**: Name of the satellite.
- **Connection ID**: ID of the connection obtained with the TLMCore server.
- **Connection State**: State of the connection (*Active*, *Connection Error* or *Pending*).
- **Fast Polling**: Time interval of the fast polling for the satellite (5, 10, 15 or 20 seconds).
- **Slow Polling**: Time interval of the slow polling for the satellite (30 or 60 seconds).
- **Element Name**: Name of the SES S.A. Probe element.
- **Element State**: State of the SES S.A. Probe element (*Present* or *Deleted*).
- **Delete**: A button to delete the table row when the element state is *Deleted*.
- **Sync**: Pressing this button will sync the LRV information from the manager element with the satellite probe element, if present.

At the bottom of the page, the **Sync All** button allows you to sync all LRV and timing information from the manager element with the probes.

### LRV Errors

This page contains the **LRV Error Table**, which shows the channels that have negative responses when trying to retrieve telemetry data.

### Alarm Preset

To facilitate the process of creating alarm templates, the **Channel** table has an **Alarm Preset column**. The content of this column corresponds to the content of the **Alarm Preset Table** on this page.

Configuring presets in the **Alarm Preset Table** can be done by importing a CSV file. To do so:

1. Select the CSV file using the **Select Alarm Preset File** drop-down list. Use the **Refresh** button to update the **Select Alarm Preset File** drop-down list if necessary.

   The connector looks for the CSV files in the following directory: "*C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\SES S.A. TEMOS\Configuration Alarm Presets"*

1. Click the button **Import File**.

You can also add a preset in the table by selecting **Create Preset** in the table's context menu. This way, you can add the presets one by one. To delete a preset, right-click the entry in the table and select **Delete Preset**. The **Remove All** button can be used to delete all the entries from the table at once. To save an alarm preset in a CSV file, click the button **Export Alarm Preset**.

Once an alarm preset has been assigned to a certain channel, this preset name can be used as a filter when you create alarm templates in DataMiner. This will allow you to configure different thresholds for the same parameter depending on the alarm preset filter.
