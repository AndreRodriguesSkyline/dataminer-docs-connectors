This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: public).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: private).

## Usage

### General Information

This section has two pages: **General** and **Status**.

The **General** page provides general information like the firmware version, model number, serial number, etc.

Multiple subpages are available:

- **M and C**: Allows you to monitor and configure Radius server and remote M and C interface settings.
- **Alarms**: Allows you to monitor and configure the thresholds for the alarms and enable or disable them.
- **Station Clock**: Allows you to monitor and configure station clock settings.
- **SAF**: Allows you to enable or disable the software-activated features.
- **NTP**: Allows you to configure NTP settings.

The **Status** page contains information retrieved from the transmitter and receiver, with some configurable parameters that can also be found on the Tx/Rx Configuration page.

### Alarm Information

This page contains alarms from the device received via SNMP traps. To configure the traps, go to the SNMP page.

### Configuration

This section contains the following pages:

- **Tx Configuration**: Contains configurable parameters for the transmitters. On the subpages, you can configure automatic uplink power control (AUPC), bit rate error test (BERT), bit rate, dropped packets, errored packets, etc.
- **Rx configuration**: Contains configurable parameters for the receiver. On the subpages, you can configure framing, bit rate, dropped packets, errored packets, LinkGuard, etc.
- **ACM**: Contains settings to configure Adaptive Coding Modulation.
- **PCMA**: Contains configurable parameters for Paired Carrier Multiple Access.

### Networking Settings

This section contains the following pages:

- **IP**: Contains configurable network parameters. There are multiple subpages, to configure Receiver, Static IPv4 routes, etc.
- **Email**: Contains the email configuration for email notifications sent from device.
