# ServersCheck SensorGateway

This connector is used to monitor the ServersCheck SensorGateway device, which acts as a hub for multiple sensors. The range of sensors that can be connected to the hub includes among others environmental, power, security, and industrial sensors.

All device information is retrieved via SNMP. The appropriate parameters are updated, and meaningful alarms are generated.
