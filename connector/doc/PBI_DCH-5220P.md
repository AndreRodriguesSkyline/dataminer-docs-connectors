## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device, by default *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device, by default *private*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector uses **SNMP** commands to communicate with the device. The connector layout generally corresponds with that of the web interface of the device.

The first part of a page corresponds with the top level of the web interface (Status, Configuration, System). The second part corresponds with the relevant subsection (E.g. Status - Decoder, Configuration - DVB-S2 Tuner, System - Device).

Note: The settings for the different types of tuner are only displayed when that particular type of tuner is installed. For example, if a **DVB-C tuner** is available instead of a DVB-S2 Tuner, the page for the tuner that will be shown is **Configuration - DVB-C Tuner**.
