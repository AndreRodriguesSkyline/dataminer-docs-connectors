# GeoSync Microwave UPC

The GeoSync Microwave UPC (Uplink Power Control) System provides control of the uplink RF power, with up to 3 attenuator modules, each capable of 20 dB of uplink power correction. The UPC is designed to adjust the uplink signal strength to minimize weather-induced variations in signal strength received by geostationary satellites. The received signals can be from a telemetry beacon or a carrier transmitted from the RF terminal and looped back into the satellite.
