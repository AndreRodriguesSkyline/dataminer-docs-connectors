## How to use

On the **Job** page, the **Job Status table** shows the jobs defined in the Data Aggregator, along with their respective status data. The table's default refresh interval is set to 30 minutes, but you can adjust this using the **Update Interval** parameter.

Any errors encountered during job executions are logged in the **Log Failure** table. The number of rows retained in this table is defined with the **Log Row Limit** and **Log Age Limit** parameters.

The **General** page also contains a tree view with an overview of the previously mentioned information.
