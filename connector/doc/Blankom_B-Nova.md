## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device, e.g. *10.11.12.13.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## Usage

### General Information

This page displays general information about the device:

- **Device Name** (can be edited)
- **Hardware Serial Number**
- **Hardware Type**
- **Hardware Version**
- **Software Version**
- **Up Time**
- **Cumulative Uptime**
- **Development Mode** (when this is enabled, the Status Codes page is displayed for debugging traps and alarm descriptions)

### Interfaces

This page displays detailed information about the available interfaces. You can also set the rate calculation method for the Interfaces table.

- The **Interfaces Table** displays information such as the interface alias, type, MTU, speed, in bit rate, out bit rate, physical address, status, etc.
- The **Transfer Table** provides information on data transfer per module.

Two subpages are available:

- **Display Key Settings**: Allows you to create custom display keys for the Interfaces Table. You can select how the display key will be formed. Note that changing the display key can result in loss of trend data.

- **Raw Tables**: Displays three tables with raw values related to interfaces that are retrieved from the device.

### Alarm Traps

On this page, the **Current Alarm Table** lists all alarms active on the device. The active alarms and the **Current Alarm State** can be monitored (with an alarm template), and you can use the **Alarm Description** as a filter in the alarm template. You can also select the display column format for service alarms in the **Service Alarms Description Format** dropdown list.

With the exception of a **Coldstart** alarm, alarms will be cleared automatically from the table. You can also manually remove an alarm from the table with the **Remove** button.

A subpage is available with settings for the **automatic cleanup** process for the **Current Alarm Table**. You can select a **maximum number** of alarms and/or a **maximum number of days** to keep alarms in the table.


### Notification Traps

The page displays notification data about the alarm severity, the module that caused an alarm, the description, the reason, and the notification parameter table.

### Log

This page displays the **Trap Log Table**, which contains a list of alarms that have been logged.

### Status Codes

This page is not displayed by default. You can enable it by enabling the development mode on **General Information** page.

This page is used for debugging. It displays information about alarm status codes for device, module, interface, transport stream, etc.
