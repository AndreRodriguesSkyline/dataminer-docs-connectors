# Nera Evo XPAND IP+

**Evo XPAND IP+** is an advanced version of radio with higher capacity and Ethernet features. Combining advanced Ethernet and TDM networking functionality with best-in-class microwave radio performance, Evo XPAND IP+ facilitates cost-effective, risk-free migration to IP/Ethernet and can be integrated in any pure IP/Ethernet, Native2 (hybrid) or TDM network.

## About

Evo XPAND IP+ features a powerful, integrated Ethernet switch for advanced networking functionality and an optional TDM cross-connect for nodal site applications. With advanced service management and Operation Administration & Maintenance (OA&M) tools, the solution simplifies network design, reduces CAPEX and OPEX and improves overall network availability and reliability to support services with stringent SLAs.

This connector communicates with the device using an **SNMP** connection, allowing the user to monitor and control features of the device.
