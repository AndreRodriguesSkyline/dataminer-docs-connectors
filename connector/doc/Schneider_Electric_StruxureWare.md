# Schneider Electric StruxureWare

The **Schneider Electric StruxureWare DCIM** (Data Center Infrastructure Management) platform is a management software suite designed to collect and manage data about a data center's assets, resource use and operation status throughout the data center lifecycle. This information is then distributed, integrated and applied in ways that help to manage and optimize the data center's performance. The **Schneider Electric StruxureWare** connector is the solution designed to monitor this platform.

## About

This connector was designed to interact with a SOAP interface. An **HTTP** connection is used to successfully retrieve the API information. This connector is also a **DVE manager**, containing a DVE table that is used to export other connectors, each of them representing a device. The list of exported connectors can be found in the "Exported Connectors" section of this page.
