# Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM

This is a configuration manager connector designed to process a single provisioning file per DMS (Device Management System) for passive components, generating unique IDs for entities within the file.

The connector is responsible for generating a CSV file for each ONT (Optical Network Terminal) change after reading from a Kafka stream topic.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

When you have created a new Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM element, define the following parameters on the **Configuration** page:

#### Import Settings

- **Entity Import Directory**: Set the generic GPON entity import path used throughout the EPM Solution.

#### Export Settings

- **Entity Export Directory**: Specify the generic GPON entity export path used throughout the EPM Solution.

#### System Credentials

- **System Username**: The username with access to the remote directory. If no domain is provided, the domain from the element's DMA location will be used.
- **System Password**: The password of the user for accessing the remote directory.

#### Topic Kafka Settings

- **Entity Export Directory**: Specify the path where KAFKA Stream update files are located.

#### Synchronization File Settings

- **File Sync Offloading Time**: Define the timing for offloading ONT statuses.

### Provisioning

The provisioning of the EPM Solution is sequential and involves the following components:

- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH** as front-end element: Responsible for the top-level data aggregation and for displaying the topologies.
- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH** as back-end element: In charge of the data aggregation from the collectors.
- **Skyline EPM Platform FTTH Collector**: In charge of the ONT data aggregation from an OLT.
- **Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM**: Creates compatible files regarding the passives available within the GPON infrastructure and the KAFKA OLT KPIs.

## How to use

The Telenet EPM Platform FTTH WM is configured to manage **ONT** statuses by extracting and parsing **GZIP** files generated by a Kafka consumer element. These statuses are then forwarded to **OLT** elements.

A file containing ONT changes is offloaded daily, encompassing all ONTs in the cluster.
