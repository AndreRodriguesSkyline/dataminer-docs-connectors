# PATLITE Corporation LA6 Series

The LA6 Series signal tower can operate in Smart Mode or Signal Tower Mode. It can control the LED and buzzer like a standard tower. In Smart Mode, various displays can be shown, such as a slow flashing rate, simulating that of a firefly, and a display that can be used as a level meter.

The PATLITE Corporation LA6 Series connector uses HTTP polling to retrieve information such as the mode, the Units table, Smart Mode parameters, etc.
