# Sencore TSS 6220

The TSS 6220 Transport Stream Server provides streaming capabilities to create automated playout of media files into multiple channels. With the onboard redundant storage and FTP and SMB file upload, the unit can take stored media files and play them out according to user-supplied schedules. Up to 16 independent schedules and corresponding MPEG over IP outputs can be maintained simultaneously. The connector itself acts as a monitoring platform that allows the user to view most of the parameters retrieved from the device and apply alarm monitoring and trending to them.
