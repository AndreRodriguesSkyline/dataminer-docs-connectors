# SED Decimator 16 port

The SED Decimator 16 port enables low-cost spectrum measurement and analysis. It contains 16 user-selectable inputs.

## About

This connector is used to monitor and control the spectrum analyzer using the proprietary SED Decimator API, which makes use of a **TCP/IP** connection.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination, which is configured to always be *9784*.

## Usage

### Spectrum Analyzer page

This page contains the spectrum analyzer interface and allows the user to see and configure traces from the device using all DMS Spectrum Analysis features.

### General page

This page contains general parameters such as the voltage, and global status parameters such as **Input Status**. With the **Active Switch** parameter, you can select the used input.

## Notes

Since it is not possible to retrieve the center frequency, frequency span or resolution bandwidth, default values are set after startup to initiate the communication. The default values are *1550 MHz* for the center frequency, *15885 Hz* for the span and *100 Hz* for the resolution bandwith.
