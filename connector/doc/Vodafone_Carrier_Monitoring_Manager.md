## Configuration

### Connections

This connector uses a **virtual** connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

The connector uses an interactive Automation script to perform the "Create" and "Update Carrier" actions. Make sure this **Carrier Configurations** script is installed.

You can also assign the dedicated **Visio drawing** to the element for easy navigation between the configured carriers and their spectrum thumbnails.

## How to use

- **Driver Status**: Will show *Not Busy* if no operation is being done or *Busy* if an operation is being executed (e.g. creating a new carrier).
- **Carrier Table**: In this table, you can add, update, or delete specific carriers via the right-click menu.
- **Spectrum Monitor Table**: This table is automatically filled in with all available spectrum monitor elements and their measurement points.
- **Configuration:** On this page, you can configure default values that will be used to configure carriers.
