Some initial configuration is required on the **General** page:

- In order to get the token for the Merlin and Media connection, specify the **Merlin Client ID** and **Merlin Client Secret** (for the Merlin token) and the **Merlin Username** and **Merlin Password** (for the Media token).
- To filter environment results such as production or staging, the **Account Number** must be filled in.
- To be able to send data to the VOD Manager app, specify the DataMiner ID, element ID and parameter ID, separated by slashes ("/"), in the **VOD Manager APP ID** parameter.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

Before you use the element, make sure everything is correctly configured on the General page (see "Initialization").

On the **Mapping** page, you can configure the mapping of the Merlin information so it can be translated to Witbe by the VOD Manager.

When everything has been correctly configured, the table on the **VOD GUID** page will be filled in with the collected information.
