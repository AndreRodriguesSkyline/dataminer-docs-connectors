# ServiceNow Tables

The ServiceNow Tables protocol is a DataMiner connector used to connect to ServiceNow Web API and retrieve the information stored in ServiceNow Tables.

## About

The ServiceNow Tables protocol is an HTTP connector. This protocol keeps a record of different ServiceNow Tables and polls them automatically every certain number of seconds or manually by customer request. For each ServiceNow Table this protocol allows to register different susbcribers. A subscriber is another DataMiner element that will be notified each time its associated ServiceNow Table is polled.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses a HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
- **Device address**: The device address. (Default: ByPassProxy)

## Usage

### General

The **General** page includes two tables: **ServiceNow Tables** and **Remote Suscribers**.

The **ServiceNow Tables** allows to register different ServiceNow tables. Using a context menu, new ServiceNow tables can be added or existing ServiceNow tables can be removed. For each entry the following parameters are displayed: **Table Name, Status, Polling Frequency, Last Polled Timestamp, Response Format, Column Filter, Row Filter** and **Response Limit**. Each ServiceNow table can be polled manually by means of the **Poll Now** button.

The **Remote Subscribers** allows to register different subscribers for each ServiceNow Table. Using a context menu, new subscribers can be added or existing subscribers can be removed from the table. For each entry the following parameters are displayed: **ServiceNow Table, DataMiner Element, Element Parameter, Parameter Index** and **Status**. The **Parameter Index** is only required if the subscriber **Parameter** is a table column.

### Configuration

The Configuration page includes two groups of parameters: **Credentials** parameters and **Timing** parameters.

The **Credentials** parameters include the ServiceNow **Server IP** address and the **Username** and **Password**.

The **Timing** configuration parameters include the interval used as a **Base Time** to refresh the ServiceNow Tables, the **Base Time** Counter that displays the number of seconds left until the next ServiceNow Tables refresh and the **Polling Flag** that indicates if a ServiceNow Table is been polled or not.

### Web Interface

Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
