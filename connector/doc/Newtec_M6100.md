# Newtec M6100

This connector is used to monitor the M6100 broadcast satellite modulator.

The transport stream analyzer makes it possible to monitor the incoming transport stream. The purpose of this feature is to help determine if a problem seen at the output of a satellite receiver is due to a problem on the satellite link or to a problem in the headend before the modulator. Consequently, it provides the possibility to identify the root cause of service outages that happened in the video headend or on the transmission path between the video MUX and the satellite modulator. Because the analyzer is built into the modulator, inserting it does not change the behavior of the signal or the topology of the network, making troubleshooting easier. This leads to a shorter defect resolution time.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.
