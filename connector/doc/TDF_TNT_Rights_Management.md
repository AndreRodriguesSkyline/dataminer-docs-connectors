## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

Configure the **Right Management Script Name** parameter with the name of the script responsible for changing the permissions of user groups.

This script is stored in Skyline's GitHub repository called **TDF-AS-TNTRightsManagement**.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

In the Group Profiles table, located on the **Group Profiles** page, you can define the "service profile" each specific group can have access to. This profile is filtered based on the following information:

- Item De Catalogue
- PS State
- Operateur Diffusion
- Client
- Contrat
- SLA
- Segmentation
- Service Type

The **Rights Management** table is updated at startup and can be manually refreshed with the **Refresh Table** button.

When this table is refreshed, the column descriptions are also updated accordingly. They are ordered based on the order of the **Group Profiles** table

When you change the group permissions for a specific service, the element will update the **Group List** property of that service and trigger the Automation script configured with the **Right Management Script Name** parameter.

The **Export to CSV** button exports the **Rights Management** table to a CSV file located in the *Documents \> Elements \> \[ElementName\]* folder. This file is automatically synced in the DMS after the export is completed.
