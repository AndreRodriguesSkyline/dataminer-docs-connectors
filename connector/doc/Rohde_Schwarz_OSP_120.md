# Rohde and Schwarz OSP 120

The Rohde Schwarz OSP 120 is a modular switch and control platform that enables users to perform RF switch and control tasks quickly. The flexibility of the Rohde Schwarz OSP 120 permits a broad scope of applications ranging from simple RF switch functions to the RF wiring of complex systems such as EMC systems.

The connector for the Rohde Schwarz OSP 120 uses serial communication to poll and control the equipment, allowing the user to enable (switch) a given path and have an overview of the modules at hand.

Two timers are used to poll the information from the device: one that polls every ten seconds for fast-varying information and another that polls every hour for semi-static information.
