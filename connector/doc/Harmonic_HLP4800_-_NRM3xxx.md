# Harmonic HLP4800 - NRM3xxx

The NRM3xxx modules are PWRBlazer scalable optical node receivers that use state-of-the-art GaAs electronics for low noise as well as high sensivity and gain.

## About

This connector uses **SNMP** polling to communicate with the corresponding device.

The connector is exported by the parent element **Harmonic HLP4800** if DVE creation is enabled. In that case, a child element using this connector will be created for each row in the **Physical Entities** table of the parent element.
