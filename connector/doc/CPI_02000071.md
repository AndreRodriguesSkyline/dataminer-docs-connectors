# CPI 02000071

This connector monitors the activity of the CPI 02000071 switchover unit. This switch controller can be interfaced with any type of amplifier that provides a dry contact output for fault status. Amplifiers could be HPAs or TWTs. Amplifier inhibits are generated based on the switch position of the two waveguide switches and may be influenced by the external alarm fault input.
