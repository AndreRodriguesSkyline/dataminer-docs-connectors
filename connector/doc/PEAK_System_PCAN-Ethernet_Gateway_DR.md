# PEAK System PCAN-Ethernet Gateway DR

The PCAN-Ethernet Gateway DR allows the connection of different CAN buses over IP networks. CAN frames are wrapped in TCP or UDP message packets and then forwarded via the IP network from one device to another. The PCAN-Ethernet Gateway DR features one LAN connection, two high-speed CAN interfaces, DIN rail casing, and support for an extended temperature range.
