# Thomson Video Networks MD6000

The Thomson Video Networks MD6000 connector has been designed to monitor and manage a single Distribution Receiver Decoder MD6000 device. This device is used for terrestrial, cable, satellite, and IPTV headends to receive and decode feeds for local re-encoding, analog delivery, or confidence monitoring.

With this connector, the device can be managed directly. The connector uses **SNMP** to establish communication with the device. The timers for data retrieval can be customized on the **Polling Control** page, with a possible range of 60 seconds to 7 days in steps of 60 seconds. A value of 0 will stop the timer.

## Configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string needed to read from the device.
- **Set community string**: The community string needed to set to the device.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector contains different pages, divided into sections.

### General

This page contains general information about the connected device.

There are several page buttons on the page, which allow you to view information and settings for the **InBand, MPEG IP Card, MPEG IP NIC**, and **Power Supply**.

### Inputs

This page displays the **Transport Stream Input Source** table and **Input** table, where the input source can be configured.

A number of page buttons at the bottom provide access to information and configuration options for the Digital Video Broadcasting Satellite Second Generation (**DVB-S2 Input, DVB-S2 Input Status, DVB-S2 Advanced Features**, and **DVB-S2 SIS**) and other input (**MPEG IP Receive, ASI, VSB, Turbo PSK**).
