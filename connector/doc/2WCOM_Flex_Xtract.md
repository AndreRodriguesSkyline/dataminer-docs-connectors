# 2WCOM Flex Xtract

This connector can be used to monitor the DVB-S/DVB-S2 Flex Xtract receiver through status parameters and to configure its network and alarm settings.

## About

To retrieve data and configure settings, SNMP is used. The connector allows you to configure alarm thresholds, network configuration parameters, and so on, so that the status of important parameters can be monitored.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP main connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
- **Device address**: Not required.

SNMP Settings

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device (e.g. *161*).
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (e.g. *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (e.g. *irdprivate*).

The page also contains the **Event Log Table**, which shows event information received from the device through SNMP traps.

### Interface

This page displays the **Front DTE Baudrate**, **Interfaces Table** and **Address Translation Table**.

### Web Interface
