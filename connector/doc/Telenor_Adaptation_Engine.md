### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTPS connection to communicate with the Telenor adaptation engine API.

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: E.g. [https://869nz3tq3l.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com](https://869nz3tq3l.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).

### Initialization

The connector requires an **API Key** and an **Instance URL** in order to start the polling. This information must be specified on the **General** page.

## How to Use

When the **API Key** and **Instance URL** have been specified, information will be retrieved and displayed in the element.

On the General page, you can change the **Polling Time**. This determines the base timer used to send commands.
