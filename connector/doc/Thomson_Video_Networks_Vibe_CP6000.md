# Thomson Video Networks Vibe CP6000

The Vibe CP6000 is a contribution platform that enables users to transport up to eight acquisition-quality SD or HD services. It is a future-proof modular rack, with four hot-swappable slots. It is based on the ATCA telecom standard and offers the highest possible quality, flexibility, and reliability. Its MPEG modules embed audio and video patterns, providing flexible error management. The Vibe CP6000 encodes and decodes up to eight stereo channels and manages Dolby E and audio uncompressed passthrough.

## About

This connector is designed to monitor the state of the audio and video of both the CP6000 encoder and decoder module. It also monitors the values of the different parameters present in the input(s) and output(s) for both the encoder and the decoder, and it allows the user to manage the transport stream for both modules (encoder and decoder). The different parameters from the device are displayed on multiple pages grouped by function.

This connector will export different connectors based on the number of slots present in the device. The current list of exported connectors can be found in the section "Exported Connectors".

From version 1.0.1.5 onwards, the **DataMiner Connectivity Framework** has been implemented in the connector.

## DataMiner Connectivity Framework

Version **1.1.0.5** of the Thomson Video Network Vibe CP6000 supports the usage of DCF and can be only used on a DMA with **8.5.7** as the minimum version.

DCF can also be implemented through the DataMiner DCF user interface and through DataMiner third-party connectors (for instance a manager).

### Interfaces

#### Dynamic Interfaces

The dynamic interfaces are created based on the number of rows in **Table 600 (DCF Input Interfaces)** and **Table 700 (DCF Output Interfaces)** for both the **decoder** and the **encoder.**

**Table 600** will contain all the DCF input interfaces for the **encoder** and **decoder**. The total number of rows depends on how many rows there are in **Table 6000 (Decoder Transport Table)** and **Table 19000 (Encoder TS Input Table)**.
Table 700** will contain all the DCF output interfaces for the **encoder** and **decoder**. The total number of rows depends on the rows in **Table 5000 (Decoder Output Table)** and **Table 33000 (Encoder Transport Table)**.

- **DEC_IN\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic Interface with type **in**.
- **ENC_IN\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic Interface with type **in**.
- **DEC_OUT\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic Interface with type **out**.
- **ENC_OUT\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type*: Dynamic Interface with type **out**.

### Connections

#### Internal Connections

The connections are made as follows:

- **DEC_IN\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type* **(ID: dynamic)** --\> **DEC_OUT\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type* **(ID: dynamic)**
- **ENC_IN\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type* **(ID: dynamic)** --\> **ENC_OUT\_***instance value*\_*Interface Type* **(ID: dynamic)**
