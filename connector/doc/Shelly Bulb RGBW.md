## How to use

Under the Light page you can toggle the light on or off and see its power usage.
In there you can change the mode from 'white' to 'rbgw'. 
Depending on the mode you can then adjust the light temperature under the *White Mode* page or adjust the color in the *Color Mode* page.

The page *Settings* will allow you to configure its wifi and Backup wifi configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Changed to the page *Settings* can break the connection between the device and the network/dma. Be careful when changing these settings.

## Notes

The device supports MQTT, but this is currently not implemented in the driver.
