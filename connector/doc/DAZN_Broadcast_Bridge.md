## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *443*).

### Initialization

When the element has been created, go to the **Settings** page, and specify the **API key**. Polling will start as soon as a correct API key has been added.

## How to use

The Events table is displayed on the **General** page.

On the **Settings** page, you can find the API key and the event request size.
