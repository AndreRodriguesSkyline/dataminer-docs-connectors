# Sencore AG 4800A

Sencore AG 4800A is a high-density modular frame designed to accommodate up to 20 cards of the openGear Multi-Definition product family.

## About

This connector contains information about the frame and the installed cards. However, because of the way the MIB is constructed and the way Sencore handles each of the cards, it is not possible to control them from within this connector. Instead, individual elements representing the cards can be created if the appropriate protocols are available.
