This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device.

### Initialization

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

On the **General** page, the **RF Digital Attenuator** will initially be set to *Not Initialized* since it only has a write command. After a new value has been set, the parameter will display the new value if the set was successful.

On the **Analog** **Status** page, the **Gain Percentage** parameter can be used to adjust (increase or decrease) the **Gain** of the HPA. When this parameter is changed, the Gain will also change proportionally. For example, if the Gain Percentage is changed from 20% to 25%, the Gain will increase by 5.
