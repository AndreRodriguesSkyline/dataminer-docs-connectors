## Configuration

### Connections

#### Main Connection - Serial

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: 2072

## How to Use

The connector does not have a polling timer. It only polls the data at element startup or when polling is triggered manually via a button in the element.

After element startup, the connector enables the reception of events (unsolicited messages).
