## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP of the Newtec DMA.
- **IP port**: 80
- **Device address**: BypassProxy

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection, for which no input is required during element creation.

### Initialization

This connector is designed to poll one DMA. In case of a cluster consisting of multiple DMAs, one element will be needed for each Agent in the cluster.

You need to specify the DMA ID of the agent you want to poll and the credentials.

On the **Polling Config** page, you can enable what you want to poll. Once this has been done, the element should start retrieving info from the other DMA.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

This connector retrieves all the **elements** and **protocols** on the specified DMA, as well as particular **tables** and **parameters** from elements, and displays these.
