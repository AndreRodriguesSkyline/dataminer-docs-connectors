## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

When you create an element with this connector, some initialization is required:

- Create a view in the Surveyor where new to-be-monitored elements can be added.
- On the **Element Management** page, fill in the name of this view in the **Managed Element View** parameter.

## How to use

When **new elements** are added for the connector to monitor, it will look for these elements in the specified **Managed Element View**. When an element is detected, it will show up in the **Element Management** or **Virtual Element Management** table, depending on its connection type. By default, the location will be set to "default".

You can **add new views to monitor** via the right-click menu of the **Location Management** table. When you add a row in this table, the connector will automatically create a new view in the same view as the manager. These views can then be assigned to the elements, which will automatically move to their designated view.
