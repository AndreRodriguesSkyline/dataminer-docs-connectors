# Astro U154 Edge QAM

With this connector, you can gather and view information from the device **Astro U154 Edge QAM**, as well as configure the device.

## About

This connector uses HTTP to monitor the **Astro U154 Edge QAM** device. The connector also has an SNMP interface to receive traps from the device.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses both an HTTP and an SNMP connection.

Depending on the setup, the **HTTP** configuration differs: this connector can communicate directly with the **U154**, but it can also be configured to send the requests to the **Astro U100 Controller**, which will then serve as a proxy.

In either case, the **SNMP** interface collects the traps emitted by the device, so the SNMP IP address must be the IP address of the **U154** (not the controller).

#### Serial Connection for Communication with U100C as Proxy

SERIAL Connection:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the Astro U100 Controller.
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, e.g. *80*.
- **Bus address**: The IP address of the U154. In addition, "*ByPassProxy*" must be filled in, in order to bypass any possible proxy that could block the HTTP communication. The two fields must be separated by a semicolon, e.g. *ByPassProxy;10.11.12.13.*

#### Serial Connection for Direct Communication

SERIAL Connection:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the U154.
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, e.g. *80*.
- **Bus address**: This field can be used to bypass the proxy. To do so, fill in the value *ByPassProxy*.

#### SNMP Connection

SNMP Connection:

- **IP Address/host**: The polling IP of the U154, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information about the device.

The credentials of the device must be filled in via the **Login** page button.

Some important parameters are available at the end of the first column:

- **Controller Name**: This parameter shows the name of the **Astro Virtual Controller** element that manages this device. If no such element is used, the parameter will show the exception value *No Virtual Controller Found*.

- **Communication Type**:

- *Direct Communication*: The element sends the requests directly to the Astro module.
  - *U100C Proxy*: The element sends the requests to the Astro U100 Controller, which will forward them to the Astro module. The controller acts as a proxy.

- **Communication Method**: This parameter is only available in *Direct Communication* mode.

- *Login*: The element logs in to the device before every request (read and write requests).
  - *Anonymous*: The element only logs in to the device for write requests. The device does not log in for read requests.

#### Configuration Files (Download/Upload)

The following table provides more information on how to upload/download configuration files to/from the device:

- To **download** a file, click *Download*. The following pop-up window will be displayed:

  ![Download.PNG](~/images/Download.PNG)

  Enter the name of the file then click on `OK'. The file will be saved at this location:

  `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\<protocol name>\<element name>\<file name>`

- To **upload** a file, click *Upload*. The following pop-up window will be displayed:

  ![Upload.PNG](~/images/Upload.PNG)

  **Module Name** lists all the Astro elements of the same type in the system.

  **Upload File Name** lists all the files available in Documents folder of the selected module.

  The file to be uploaded is located at: `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\<protocol name>\<element name>\<file name>`

#### Software Update

The connector allows you to upload a firmware archive from the local disk of the DMA:

![SoftwareUpdate.PNG](~/images/Astro_U154_Edge_QAM_SoftwareUpdate.PNG)

The **Firmware File** parameter is used to select which file to upload. The drop-down list contains all the files present in the following directory of the DMA: *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\Protocol Name\>*.

Once the file is selected, click the button **Update and Reboot** to start the upgrade. To follow the update progress, click the **Update Progress** page button. However, traps must be configured for this to be possible.
