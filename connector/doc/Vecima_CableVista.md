## Installation and configuration

### Creation

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: 161
- **Get community string**: public
- **Set community string**: private

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information about the device.

- **System Name:** The system name.

- **System Description:** The system description with the version and compilation date.

- **System Uptime:** Time that the device has been operating.

- **Model Number:** Decoder model number.

- **Serial Number:** Unit serial number.

- **Config Modified:** Indicates whether or not the configuration has been modified.

- **Save Status:** Save status state.

- **Reboot:** Reboots the device.

- **Interfaces:** Contains information about the state of the existing interfaces.

- **Interf. Type:** The type of interface. Additional values are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANA Interf. Type textual convention.
  - **Interf. Mtu:** The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
  - **Interf. Speed:** An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in Mbits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth.
  - **Interf. MAC Address:** The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this parameter normally contains a MAC address.
  - **Interf. Admin State:** The desired state of the interface. The testing state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with **Interf. Admin State** in the *Down* state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, **Interf. Admin State** is then changed to either the *Up* or *Testing* states (or remains in the *Down* state).
  - **Interf. Oper. State:** The current operational state of the interface. The testing state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If **Interf. Admin State** is *Down* then **Interf. Oper. State** should be *Down*. If **Interf. Admin State** is changed to *Up* then **Interf. Oper. State** should change to *Up* if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the *Down* state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the *Up* state; it should remain in the not present state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
  - **Interf. In Octets:** The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system.
  - **Interf. In Rate:** Rate of received octets.
  - **Interf. In Unicast Packets:** The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher sub-layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer.
  - **Interf. In Discards:** The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.
  - **Interf. In Errors:** For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.
  - **Interf. Out Octets:** The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters.
  - **Interf. Out Rate:** Transmitted octets rate.
  - **Interf. Out Unicast Packets:** The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent.
  - **Interf. Out Discards:** The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.
  - **Interf. Out Errors:** For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.
