# Pro-Bel SW-P-08

The Pro-Bel SW-P-08 connector provides an interface to set or remove connections in the output routing of a controlled device from remote devices. It can be used to monitor and control any router that supports the Pro-Bel SW-P-08 protocol. A serial connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the matrix. A matrix is used in order to easily connect a destination with a source.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Direct connection:
  - **Baudrate**: Baudrate specified in the manual of the device (default: 9600).
  - **Databits**: Databits specified in the manual of the device (default: 8).
  - **Stopbits**: Stopbits specified in the manual of the device (default: 1).
  - **Parity**: Parity specified in the manual of the device (default: No).
  - **FlowControl**: FlowControl specified in the manual of the device (default: No).
- Interface connection:
  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The "Matrix Number", "Level Number", "Number of Inputs" and "Number of Outputs" of the matrix, separated by a period ("."). The range of inputs and outputs is 1-1024. For instance: "*1024.1024*".

## Usage

The element consists of the following pages: **Matrix** and **General**.

### Matrix

This page contains the matrix, sized according to the **Number of Inputs** and **Number of Outputs** specified during configuration.

### General

This page contains the following parameters:

- **Matrix Configuration:** Displays any detected misconfigurations. The status **OK** indicates that the matrix was successfully configured.
- **Number of Inputs:** Displays the selected number of inputs for the matrix.
- **Number of Outputs:** Displays the selected number of outputs for the matrix.
- **Last KeepAlive Timestamp:** Displays the last timestamp received.
- **Number of Wrong CRCs Received**: The number of wrong CRCs received on a message.
- **Name Length**: The number of characters of a name.
- **Refresh Names:** This button allows you to refresh the associated destination and source names.
