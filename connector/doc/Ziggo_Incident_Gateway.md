# Ziggo Incident Gateway

The **Ziggo Incident Gateway** connector will generate an SNMP trap to register an event to the SAM system.

## About

The **Ziggo Incident Gateway** receives info that is collected by the MICA interactive automation script. This script makes it possible to initiate an incident without the existence of alarms.
