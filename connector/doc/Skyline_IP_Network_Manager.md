# Skyline IP Network Manager

## Configuration

### System Requirements

In order to use the IP Network Manager, you will need at least DataMiner version 8.0.3.

### Setup

Initially, the application will not hold any devices to manage. It is therefore necessary to perform a discovery before you can start using the IP Network Manager. For this, you can use the **Discovery Wizard** of the application.

## How to Use

You should use DataMiner Cube to use the IP Network Manager Application. In the Surveyor in Cube, go to **Apps**. Then click **IP Network Manager** to open the application.

### Map

When you open the application for the first time, the **map** page will be empty. In order to start working with the IP Network Manager, a discovery is needed to populate the application with devices. For this, you need to use the **Discovery Wizard**.

The map page shows the network devices that the application is managing. An icon is used to represent a device.

| Icon | Device Type |

Go to this page to get a overview of the managed devices.

#### List

The subpage **List** shows the devices that are managed by the application. Specifically, the table contains the following columns:

- **IP**: The IP address by which the device is managed.
- **DNS/NetBIOS Name**: A textual representation by which the device is identified.
- **Device Type**: The type that the application has classified the devices into. You can manually override the device type.
- **sysDescr**: The system description as found on the device.
- **Network/Prefix**: The network address and network mask (in prefix notation) of the IP address from the IP column.
- **Discovery Status**: The status of the last discovery.
- **LInked Element**: The element name of the DataMiner element linked to this device.

Additionally, there are number of options available in the **context menu**. You can right-click a row to select one of these options:

- **Create Element**: This will allow you to create a DataMiner element from a discovered device. After you select this option, a pop-up window will allow you to supply the following information for the element you are creating:

  - **Element Name**: The name for the element.
  - **Polling IP**: The IP address
  - **Protocol**: The DataMiner connector that should be used. Note that the production version will be used automatically.

- **Link Element**
