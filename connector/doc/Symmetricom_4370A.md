# Symmetricom 4370A

The Symmetricom 4370A connector can be used to monitor and control the Symmetricom 4370A master time generator.

The connector polls data from the Symmetricom 4370A via SNMP. It also handles traps, by parsing a trap for the OID of the parameter that causes the trap and repolling the parameter for an updated value.
