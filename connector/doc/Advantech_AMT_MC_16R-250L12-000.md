# Advantech AMT MC 16R-250L12-000

The Advantech AMT MC 16R-250L12-000 is a monitoring and control panel for redundant Solid State Block Up-Converters (SSPBs). This connector can be used to monitor this device.

## About

The monitoring and control panel is used for redundant high-power SSPBs, monitoring the status of two units in a redundant system and allowing control over the SSPBs. This device will monitor the slave SSPBs continuously, collecting and updating information as well as controlling the SSPBs as required, using the SC protocol.
