# Teleste HDO103 TSEMP

The HDO103 is an RF switch module used for signal backup purposes. HDO103 has an extended frequency range to fulfil DOCSIS 3.1 requirements.

The unit has two inputs with RF wideband detectors and one output. The HDO103 will detect the loss of signal power on the active input port and automatically switch from the active port to the alternate port, restoring network continuity. A user can change the switching decision limits via UI.

A **serial** connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the information of the device. There are also different possibilities available for **alarm monitoring** and **trending**.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Connection â€“ Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the HDO103 device.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the HDO103 device.

### How to Use

The connector uses serial commands to request and push information to and from the node. This communication can be seen in the Stream Viewer.

The element using the HDO103 connector has several data pages:

- On the **General** page, you can find all the details related to general information about the device, and you can set the device name.

- The **Monitoring** page contains two tables for analog and discrete alarm limits. You can configure those two tables.

- The **Adjustment** page contains the most important parameters. Here you can configure RF switch module.
