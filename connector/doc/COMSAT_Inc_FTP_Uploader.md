## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection - Main

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

On the **General** page, use the **Linked Element** parameter to specify the name of the ACU element within the DataMiner System.

To make use of the FTP exporting, input the FTP setting information on the **FTP & Email Config** page. Additionally, Automation scripts can be used to send an email on success or failure of the FTP upload using the **Email Automation Scripts** section.

## How to use

By default, the element will export real-time trending data from the **Linked Element** every 24 hours with an interval of 5 minutes. These two values can be configured as necessary.

When the **Next Upload Time** has passed, the data is gathered and placed into the "Skyline DataMiner\DMA_COMMON_DOCUMENTS\ACU_DATA" folder of the DataMiner System. The format of the created file can be defined with **File Prefix** and **File Timestamp Format**.

After a successful upload attempt, the **Upload Statistics** will be set with the **Status**, **Upload Time**, and **Filename**. If an upload was unsuccessful, the **Next Upload Time** will be increased but the **Last Successful Upload Time** will not change. On the next attempt to upload, data will be gathered up to the **Last Successful Upload Time**.
