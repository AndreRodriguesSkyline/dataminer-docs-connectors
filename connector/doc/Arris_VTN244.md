# Arris VTN244

The **ARRIS Versatile Telecommunications Node (VTN) 244** is designed to act as a Deep 2x2 Optical Node. The node can be deployed as a cost-effective 1x1 and scales easily to a 2x2 to manage network demands. The VTN244 can be configured with an optional Euro-DOCSIS or DOCSIS status monitor transponder for remote management and control. The node can also be configured with Ingress Control Switches to allow operators to diagnose upstream noise issues.
