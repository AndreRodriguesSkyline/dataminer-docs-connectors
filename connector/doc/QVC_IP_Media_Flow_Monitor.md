## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

Specify the names of the Cisco DCNM and Imagine Communications Magellan SDNO elements from which information is to be retrieved. Also specify how often the information should be retrieved.

## How to Use

The **Last Operation Duration** parameter indicates how long it took to process the information on the last update. The polling frequency can be adjusted if necessary.

You can also enable notifications via information events on the Cisco DCNM and Imagine Communications Magellan SDNO. These information events can be used with a Correlation rule to trigger the polling of the information.
