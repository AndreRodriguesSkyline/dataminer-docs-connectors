# Astro U158 Edge QAM

With this connector, it is possible to gather and view information from the device **Astro U158 Edge QAM**, as well as to configure the device.

## About

This connector uses an **HTTP** connection to monitor the Astro U158 Edge QAM device.

This connector also contains an **SNMP** interface to receive traps from the device. These traps will automatically update the relevant parameter, generating an alarm if needed.

## Installation and configuration

### Creation

This connector uses two interfaces: an HTTP interface to retrieve the data and an SNMP interface to collect the traps.

#### HTTP connection

This connector can communicate directly with the **U158** but it can also be configured to send requests to the **Astro U100 Controller**, which will then serve as a proxy. Depending on the communication mode, the HTTP connection must be configured differently:

#### A) Communication with U100C as proxy

**SERIAL connection:**

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the Astro U100 Controller.
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, e.g. *80*.
- **Bus address**: The IP address of the U158. Also, fill in 'ByPassProxy' to bypass any possible proxy that could block the HTTP communication. Both fields must be separated by a semicolon. For example: *ByPassProxy;10.11.12.13*.

#### B) Direct Communication

**SERIAL connection:**

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the U158.
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, e.g. *80*.
- **Bus address**: This field can be used to bypass the proxy. To do so, fill in the value *ByPassProxy*.

#### SNMP connection

Regardless of the HTTP connection configuration, the SNMP interface collects the traps emitted by the device, so the SNMP IP address must be the IP address of the **U158** (not the controller).

**SNMP Connection:**

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the U158, e.g. *10.11.12.13*.

**SNMP Settings:**

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
- **Set community string**: The community string in order to set to the device. The default value is *private*.

## Usage

### General

This page displays general information about the device.

The credentials of the device must be filled in via the **Login** page button.

Some important parameters are available at the end of the first column:

- **Controller Name**: This parameter shows the name of the **Astro Virtual Controller** element that manages this device. If no such element is used, the parameter will show the exception value *No Virtual Controller Found*.

- **Communication Type**:

  - *Direct Communication*: The element sends the requests directly to the Astro module device.
  - *U100C Proxy*: The element sends the requests to the Astro U100 Controller, which will forward them to the Astro module. The controller acts as a proxy.

- **Communication Method**: This parameter is only available in **Direct Communication** mode.

  - *Login*: The element logs in to the device for every request (read and write requests).
  - *Anonymous*: The element only logs in to the device for write requests. The device does not log in for read requests.

### NIT 1

This page displays the NIT1 settings.

To add an external transport stream, right-click the table, select **Add External Transport Stream**, and specify the necessary information.

### NIT 2

This page displays the NIT2 configurations.

To add an external transport stream, use the same procedure as explained for the NIT1 page.

### LCN

This page displays the LCN configurations.

### Update/Config

This page allows you to upload and download config files to the device. You can also perform a software update via this page.

#### Configuration files (download/upload)

To download a file:

1. Click **Download**. The following pop-up message will be displayed:

   ![Download.PNG](~/images/Astro_U158_Edge_QAM_Download.PNG)

1. Enter the name of the file and click OK. The file will be saved in the following location:

    C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\protocol name\>\\element name\>\\file name\>

To upload a file:

1. Click **Upload**. The following pop-up window will be displayed:

   ![Upload.PNG](~/images/Astro_U158_Edge_QAM_Upload.PNG)

1. In this window, **Module Name** lists all the Astro elements of the same type in the system. **Upload File Name** lists all the files available in the Documents folder of the selected module.

   The file to be uploaded must be located in the following folder: C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\protocol name\>\\element name\>\\file name\>

#### Software update

The connector allows you to upload a firmware archive from the local disk of the DMA:

![SoftwareUpdate.PNG](~/images/Astro_U158_Edge_QAM_SoftwareUpdate.PNG)

The **Firmware File** parameter is used to select which file to upload. The drop-down list contains all the files present in the following folder on the DMA: C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\\Protocol Name\>.

When you have selected the file, click **Update and Reboot** to start the upgrade. To view the progress of the update, click the **Update Progress** page button. However, traps must be configured for this.
