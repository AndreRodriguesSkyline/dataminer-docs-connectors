# Pixel Power Clarity

This connector allows the user to view a report for each Clarity, describing the status of the loaded job and of any pending jobs.

## About

The connector presents its information in two tables, the **System Table** and the **Clarity Table**. There, you will find information about the overall status that can be used as a top-level indicator of whether or not there are any issues within the system. The data of these tables is polled via **SNMP** protocol every 10 seconds.
