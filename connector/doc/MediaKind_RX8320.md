## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The connector uses SNMP retrieval to poll all of its parameters.

The **Status page** gives an overview of the main parameters from the other pages, so that you can find the most important status information summarized on this page.

The **Alarms** **page** contains the main parameters for monitoring.

The connector mirrors the web UI of the device, with the exception of a few parameters that were not exposed via SNMP in the initial development.

**Traps are not yet implemented in this initial version.**
