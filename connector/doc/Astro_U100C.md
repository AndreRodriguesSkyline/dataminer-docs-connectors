HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The IP address of the Astro U100 Controller.
- **IP port**: The port of the destination, by default *80*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.* This is enabled by default.

#### SNMP Trap Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string in order to read from the device. The default value is *public*.
