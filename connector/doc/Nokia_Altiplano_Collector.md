# Nokia Altiplano Collector

The Nokia Altiplano Access Controller is a cloud-based network management application to visualize, optimize, and enhance the fixed access network, supporting SDN-native, legacy, and third-party equipment.

The Nokia Altiplano Collector connector collects the smart-serial response of Nokia Access Management System and Altiplano alarms and displays them in a single table.
