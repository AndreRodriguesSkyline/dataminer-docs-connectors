This connector uses a Telnet (serial) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: default: *4001*

### Initialization

No additional configuration of parameters is necessary in a newly created element.

### Redundancy

## How to use

Once you have created the element polling the correct serial gateway (using port 4001), the General page will display all weather metrics.
