# Evertz 7x00 General Platform - 7746FSEAES8HD

The 7746FS-EAES8-HD HD frame synchronizer is designed to re-time an SMPTE 292M (1080i/60, 1080i/59.94, 1080i/50, 1080p/24sF, 1080p/23.98sF, 720p/60, 720p/59.94, 720p/50, 1035i/59.94, 1035i/60, or 480p/59.94) or SMPTE 259M (625i/50, 525i/59.94 ) input to a local reference tri-level or composite sync signal. When necessary, frames are repeated or dropped to maintain synchronization. During the synchronizing process, the video delay varies from 3 lines through to 1 frame plus 3 lines. Additional delay can be added to the synchronizing process in 1-frame increments.
