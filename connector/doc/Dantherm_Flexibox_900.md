## Usage

### General

This page contains general information on the Flexibox device, such as the network connection information and various serial numbers.

It is also possible to access the **SNMP Configuration** parameters via a page button, as well as **High Level Controls** such as **Cooling/Heater Set Points**.

**Note:** After you configure settings related to the network information, such as **Host Name** or **DHCP State**, press the **Save Configuration** button to accept the changes. The same goes for the **SNMP Configuration** and other configuration pages.

### System Status

This page displays the status of the system. At the top of the page, you can find the **System Temperatures**. The status of each zone, fan and damper can be found in separate boxes below.

Page buttons provide access to specific **Digital Alarms** and **Controller** **Alarms**.

### Cooling Configuration

This page displays the configuration parameters for **Fan 1** and **Fan 2.** After you perform changes on these parameters, press the **Save Configuration** button to make the device accept the changes.

There are also page buttons leading to configuration parameters for the **Heater**, **Humidity**, **Air Conditioners** and **Dampers.** After you perform changes, make sure to press the **Save Configuration** button on the relevant page.

### System Configuration

This page displays system configuration parameters, such as the **Cooling Mode**, **Zone Configuration** and **System Limits**. After you perform changes on these parameters, press the **Save Configuration** button to make the device accept the changes.
