## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection. However, it requires no input from the user, as this connector is automatically created by the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform**.

## How to use

The connector requires no user input. The metrics that are polled for this resource type element are displayed on the **Metrics** page. The following metrics are monitored:

- Active Connections
- Failed Connections
- CPU percent
- IO percent
- Memory percent
- Storage percent

On the **General** page, you can configure the **Polling Interval** for the metrics. This same page also displays the scope (Subscription and Resource Group) this resource type element belongs to.

## Notes

This connector is intended to be used together with the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform** connector. Without this manager connector, the connector will not work, as the authentication to the Azure Cloud Platform is done via the manager connector.
