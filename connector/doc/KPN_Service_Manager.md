## How to Use

### General

The **Summary Table** displays the severity of each path in every monitored view. Severities are updated using subscriptions.

The monitored views are the views located under the **Customers** view and complying with the format '(*Customer*) (*Location*) Programs/Streams'. Monitored views are detected at startup, but you can refresh them by clicking the **Refresh Subscriptions** button.
