# iDirect X7 Satellite Router

The iDirect X7 Satellite Router is a multi-core hardware system that enables service providers to deliver the data rates needed for bandwidth-heavy business applications and multicast services like IP TV, distance learning, HD broadcast, digital signage and video. It features a compact, rack-mount design, embedded 8-port switch, a 2nd DVB-S2 demodulator, variant power supply configurations, making it suitable for voice and data services that simultaneously receive multicast channels over the same or over a second transponder or satellite - even when spot-beam HTS capacity is combined with Ku and C-band capacity.
