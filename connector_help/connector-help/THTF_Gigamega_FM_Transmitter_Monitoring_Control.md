## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP address of the THTF Gigamega FM Transmitter Monitoring Control.

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the THTF Gigamega FM Transmitter Monitoring Control. By default this is *161*.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **Main** page of the connector contains the **Statuses Table**, which displays information about the traps that are received from the machines in several sites.

In the table, the **Unique Name** column shows the name of the device for which status information is displayed. This name is a concatenation of **Site Name / Machine Name / (EXC/PS/PA + Machine Index)**.

Each row shows alarm information, such as **Transm. Disconn.**, **sMPS Fault**, etc. It also shows the date and time when it was last updated in the **Last Update Time** column.

With the **Remove Row** button, you can remove a row. This can be useful in case a device was renamed, its location was changed, or it was taken out of production.

## Notes

The following **notifications** are supported:

- **Clear Traps**: Clears all alarms for a particular transmitter.
- **Clear Site**: Clears all alarms for all devices from a particular site.
- **Clear All**: Clears all alarms for all devices from all sites.
