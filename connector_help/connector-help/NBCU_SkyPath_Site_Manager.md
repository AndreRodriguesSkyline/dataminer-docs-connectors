## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - SFP 1

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

#### HTTP Connection - SFP 2

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

#### HTTP Connection - SFP 3

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

#### HTTP Connection - SFP 4

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).

### Initialization

On the **Flow Templates** page, fill in the **DataMiner ID/Element ID** of the remote element that holds the data to facilitate switching of the site.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

The connector will automatically poll the 4 SFPs defined in the element connections and fill the **SFP** table on the **General** page.

On that page, you can define the **Site Type** and **Site Mode**. If you change the **Site Mode**, the flows and networks associated with the SFPs will be changed to the selection.
