- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *80*).
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The element has the following data pages:

- **General**: Contains the measured values of temperature, humidity and dew point.
- **Extreme Values**: Displays the lowest and highest values that have been measured since the last reset or since the element was created. The information is displayed in a table with the values and the times those values were detected. The maximum and minimum limits defined by the user are also displayed.
