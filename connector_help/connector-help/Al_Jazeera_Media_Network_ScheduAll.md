# Al Jazeera Media Network ScheduAll

This is a custom connector developed for Al Jazeera. It can be used to parse location and reporter information from ScheduAll.

A custom restful API was developed on the ScheduAll side to retrieve certain info (like "Locations" and "Reporters") that is not available in the regular chorus API.
