- [Sky UK VICC](xref:Connector_help_Sky_UK_VICC)

- **Data Update Trigger**
  - **Channel From User**

## How to Use

A service created using this connector will have the data pages detailed below.

### Alarms

This page displays the **Early Warning List Table**, with an entry for each back-to-back scheduled video item. The table displays the Cause, Alarm State, Channel, Alarm Time and Target UI.

### Device Data

This page contains several internal parameters.

The **VICC Update** parameter indicates the last update trigger received from the VICC and will also trigger internal processing.

The **VICC DMA-Elem ID** parameter is a reference to the VICC element configured in the service. It is used to find the correct element to request data from and is automatically filled in.

The **Channel Bus** and **Service Status** are also displayed. When the latter is *Off-Air*, this workflow will not trigger any alarms. If it is *NA* or *On-Air*, the workflow will run as expected.

### Subscriptions Active

This page contains a table with parameters contained within the service.
