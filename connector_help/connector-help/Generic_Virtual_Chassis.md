## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to Use

### Adding an element

Right-click the table and select the option to add an element. This will open a pop-up window where you will need to specify the Element Name, Slot, and Width. After you have provided the element name, the DMA ID/Element ID will automatically be retrieved, and the table will be filled in with the new element, if it exists, and if the element has not been added already.

### Deleting one or more elements

You can delete one or more elements by selecting them in the table, right-clicking them and selecting **Delete selected module(s)**. This will show a confirmation prompt. When you confirm, the selected elements will be deleted.

### Modifying an element

Click the pencil icon in a slot or width cell to modify the value. Note that you cannot assign multiple elements to a single slot.
