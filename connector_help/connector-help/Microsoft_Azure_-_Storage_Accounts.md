# Microsoft Azure - Storage Accounts

Azure Storage Accounts contain all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection. However, it requires no input from the user, as this connector is automatically created by the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform**.

## How to use

The connector requires no user input. The metrics that are polled for this resource type element are displayed on the **Metrics** page. The following metrics are monitored:

- Availability
- Egress
- Ingress
- Success E2E Latency
- Transactions
- Used capacity

On the **General** page, you can configure the **Polling Interval** for the metrics. This same page also displays the scope (Subscription and Resource Group) this resource type element belongs to.

## Notes

This connector is intended to be used together with the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform** connector. Without this manager connector, the connector will not work, as the authentication to the Azure Cloud Platform is done via the manager connector.
