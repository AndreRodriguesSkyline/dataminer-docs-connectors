# KVM-TEC Switching Manager

The **KVM Switching Manager** **software** is used to manage a KVM network. It allows up to 2000 endpoints as well as super-fast switching. A wide range of different sources (servers, operator workstations, PCs, surveillance cameras, video walls, etc.) can be connected. The entire system can be operated and controlled via a centralized management Network Environment.

This connector allows you to monitor the **users, groups, and extenders**.

## How to Use

The element consists of the following data pages:

- **General**: Allows you to connect to the KVM Switching Manager (see Initialization section above) and shows **version** and the **connection status** information.
- **General Settings**: Contains basic settings and information for the switch.
- **Network Interfaces**: Lists the network interfaces.
- **Extenders**: Lists all extenders. You can also see which **group** they are in. The **Extender Settings** subpage allows you to change the settings of an extender, as well as to view extender info and update status info.
- **Mouse, Glide and Switch**: Contains a table with the mouse glide switch configurations as well as a table listing the configured virtual monitors.
- **Roles:** Contains an overview of all users and user groups. The same information is available in table form on the **Users and Groups** subpage. On the **Roles Settings** subpage, you can add or remove a user from a group by first selecting the user in the Edit Username box, then selecting the group in the Edit Group box, and then clicking the relevant button. You can also delete a group.
