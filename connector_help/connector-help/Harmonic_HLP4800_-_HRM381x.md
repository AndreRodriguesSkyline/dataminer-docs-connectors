# Harmonic HLP4800 - HRM381x

The HRM381x modules are optical receivers ideal for supertrunking and hub interconnections. They use state-of-the-art GaAs amplifiers for low noise, low non-linear distortions and superior flatness.

## About

This connector uses **SNMP** polling to communicate with the corresponding device.

The connector is exported by the parent element **Harmonic HLP4800** if DVE creation is enabled. In that case, a child element using this connector will be created for each row in the **Physical Entities** table of the parent element.
