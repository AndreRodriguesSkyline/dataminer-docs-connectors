# Miteq NSU2-C

The MITEQ NSU2-C/C23823 improves reliability for advanced satellite communications systems. The NSU2-C system consists of an NSU2 Control Unit, Switch Modules, and fiber-optic transmitters and receivers.

The NSU2 Control Unit monitors the status of each of the fiber-optic receivers and the fiber-optic transmitters. When a fault is detected on any component in a primary path, the defective path is automatically placed into standby, and the backup path is placed online using the switch modules.
