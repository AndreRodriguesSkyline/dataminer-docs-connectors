SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

## How to use

This connector provides an overview of the Upstream Splitter Combiner modules connected to this controller and monitors the power supply.

It also shows the last trap message and allows configuration of the trap destination.

This connector will export different connectors based on the retrieved data. A list can be found in the section "System Info". The connector will check every hour for newly connected modules. You can speed up this process by clicking the **Refresh** button on the **Module Overview** page.

## Notes

**Only one element** can poll a device at a time. Polling one device with multiple elements at the same time could lead to unexpected behavior.
