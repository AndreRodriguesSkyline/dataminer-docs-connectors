# Nevion TNS460

The Nevion TNS460 HD/SD SDI monitor is used for continuous monitoring of uncompressed video signals.

This connector uses an HTTP connection to retrieve information from the device and send commands to the device. The commands sent to the device are based on its communication protocol, the TXP - T-VIPS XML protocol.

The layout of the connector mirrors the web interface of the device as much as possible. For more information about this device, refer to <https://nevion.com/products/tns460/>.
