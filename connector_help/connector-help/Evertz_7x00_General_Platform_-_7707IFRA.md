# Evertz 7x00 General Platform - 7707IFRA

This connector is used to monitor and control the Evertz 7707IFRA card (which belongs to the LR card family). The 7707IFRA is a VistaLink Pro capable fiber-optic receiver for 70/140 MHz IF signals. The 7707IFRA accepts a fiber-optic input from the companion 7707IFTA and provides two 70/140 MHz IF output signals. Monitoring and control of card status and parameters is provided locally at the card edge and remotely via VistaLink Pro capability.

An SNMP connection is used in order to successfully retrieve and configure the information of the device. There are also different possibilities available for alarm monitoring and trending.
This connector is automatically generated by the parent connector [Evertz 7x00 General Platform](xref:Connector_help_Evertz_7x00_General_Platform).
