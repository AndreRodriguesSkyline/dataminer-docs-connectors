SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: \[The bus address of the device.\]

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configurations are needed.

### Redundancy

- Network: Presents the **Network Interfaces** table where the user can access and modify various information, **IPv4 address/netmask/gateway**, **Link Speed, Link Mode**, etc..
- IPV2: Displays two tables - **IP Statistics** and **IP Configuration**.

### Transport Stream

In this page, there is the **Services** table which enlists all current services and their details, such as, **video encoding type**, **list of video/audio PIDs**, **minimum** and **maximum** **bit rates**, **provider name**, etc..

It is also possible to select the **ASI input, reset the services bit rates** and **freeze the Services table**.

### Satellite

In this page, the user is able to monitor multiple KPIs of the both DVB-S/S2 Satellite inputs, such as: **Lock Status, Symbol Rate, BER, Modulation Code**, etc..

It is also possible to change the settings for both inputs, for example: **DVB Mode** (*Automatic* or *Manual*), **Satellite/LNB/Tuner frequencies**, **input Polarization** (*Vertical* or *Horizontal*) and **Band** (*Low-band* or *High-band*), etc..

### Headend

In this page, the user can change **Network**, **PLP Adaptation**, **Input** (Main and Secondary) and **Output** settings, as well as monitor the **ASI** and **Satellite Bit Rates** on both inputs.

Through this page 6 subpages can be accessed:

- SI Update: Presents the **SI Update** table, which allow the user to set which SI tables to output, per PLP; and multiple settings about the SI Processing
- Network: Displays both **Managed** and **Non Managed Frequency** tables, where the user is able to enable or disable them and set their frequency value.
- PLP Adaptation: Displays both **PLP Insertion** and **PLP Aggregation** tables
- Content Insertion: Let the user enable and configure the **Emergency Warning System** feature.
- Main PLP Monitor: Displays the list of all available PLPs on main input
- Sec PLP Monitor: Displays the list of all available PLPs on secondary input

### Alarms
