# Apache Cassandra Cluster Monitor

Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL database designed to provide scalability, reliability, and availability with linear performance scaling. Cassandra databases are designed as a distributed system, aimed to handle big data efficiently.

This connector is designed to monitor a Cassandra cluster, providing useful information on nodes, roles, tables, repair history, and more.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual Connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

**Note (only for the 1.0.0.x range): Make sure *ApacheCassandraCluster.dll* and *System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll* are present on the DMA in the folder *C:\Skyline DataMiner\Files*.**

### Initialization

When the element has been created, configure the connection to the Cassandra cluster. To do so, on the **Connector Settings** page, specify the **IP**, **Port**, **User Name,** and **Password**.

## How to Use

When the connection on the **Connector Settings** page has been configured, information from the Cassandra cluster will be retrieved and displayed in the element.
