# Snell Wilcox IQAES00

The Snell Wilcox IQAES00 connector monitors and controls changes on the amplifier unit through a **RollCall** **smart-serial** protocol. The card is used on the **IQ Modular Chassis**.

The connector periodically polls relevant information from the device. This happens every 15 seconds for RollCall-protocol purposes and every two hours for back-channel purposes.
