# Nokia NFM-P

Nokia NFM-P connector is used by Kordia to track the alarm events in the NFM-P network via XML API and JMS subscription. The XML API is an NFM-P interface that provides an XML interface ot the NFM-P through which an OSS client application can retrieve NFM-P network management information, receive event notifications from the NFM-P server using a persistent or non-persistent JMS connection.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - Main

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Initialization

In addition to the above HTTP settings, All the arguments in the JMS Configuration page has to be provided in a newly created element.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector uses SOAP calls to retrieve the device information and JMS connection to receive alarm events.

- You can find the system relation information on the **General** page of this connector. JMS Connection parameter shows the status of the connection, if it is Active or Inactive.
- The **JMS Configuration** page contains the mandatory input arguments that must be provided to establish a JMS connection.
- On the **Alarms** page, you can find the list of alarms in the Alarm Events table. There is a Refresh button on the same page that can be used to get all alarms on the NFM-P main server and refresh the Alarm Events table. Note: Since the volume of the alarms might be high, this can have a performance impact on the system, if triggered frequently.
- The **Events Received** page displays a table which temporarily stores the event messages before processing them. Note: It is a volatile table and hence trending and alarming cannot be enabled.
