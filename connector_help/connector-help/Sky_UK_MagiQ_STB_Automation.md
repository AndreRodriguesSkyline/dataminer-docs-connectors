## How to use

The **Automation Control** table is used to control and monitor the STB boxes.

Before you send commands using the **Send** button in the **Send Command** column, make sure to enter a valid remote control command sequence in the **Command Sequence** field. If no command data is provided or if it is not provided in the correct JSON format, a pop-up message will be displayed.

The **Check Motion/Audio** button can be used to check if there is **video** and **audio** in the selected stream. Note that to capture correct video/audio detection data, the threshold and coordinate parameters need to be configured properly.

For some DataMiner versions, the **Capture** button in the **Screen Grab** column might not properly save the images in the designated folder.
