## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Direct connection:

  - **Bus address:** between 0 and 255
  - **Baudrate**: Should match the settings on the pCO5 and application.
  - **Databits**: Should match the settings on the pCO5 and application.
  - **Stopbits**: Should match the settings on the pCO5 and application.
  - **Parity**: Should match the settings on the pCO5 and application.
  - **FlowControl**: Should match the settings on the pCO5 and application.

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Range: *0-255*.

### Configuration

The **Carel PCO5 Lennox** needs to be set to the bus parameter selected in DataMiner.

In case of a direct **serial connection**, the pCO5+ application settings for baud rate, stop bits, and parity need to match the ones specified in DataMiner.
