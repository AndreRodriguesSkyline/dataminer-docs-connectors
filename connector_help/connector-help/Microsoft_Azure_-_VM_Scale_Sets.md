# Microsoft Azure - VM Scale Sets

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets allow you to create and manage a group of load-balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide high availability to your applications, and allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection. However, it requires no input from the user, as this connector is automatically created by the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform**.

## How to use

The connector requires no user input. The metrics that are polled for this resource type element are displayed on the **Metrics** page. The following metrics are monitored:

- Percentage CPU
- Network In Total
- Network Out Total
- Disk Read Bytes
- Disk Write Bytes

On the **General** page, you can configure the **Polling Interval** for the metrics. This same page also displays the scope (Subscription and Resource Group) this resource type element belongs to.

## Notes

This connector is intended to be used together with the **Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform** connector. Without this manager connector, the connector will not work, as the authentication to the Azure Cloud Platform is done via the manager connector.
