# Vizrt Viz Graphic Hub

The Viz Graphic Hub makes the database available to clients in the network. To log in to and work with Viz Artist, users must connect to a running Viz Graphic Hub server on a machine in the network. The server is started and shut down from the Viz Graphic Hub Terminal.

The Viz Graphic Hub REST is a web service for Viz Graphic Hub. It is an interface to retrieve and send data to and from Viz Graphic Hub via HTTP requests. This connector allows you to monitor the global data, functions, and REST agent of the Viz Graphic Hub.
