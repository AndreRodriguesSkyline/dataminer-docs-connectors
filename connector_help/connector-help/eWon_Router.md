## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device. (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device. (default: *private*).

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **General page** displays general information such as Identification, Memory, Boot Time, Device Type, Serial Number, etc.

On the **Tag page**, the **Tag Table** can be used as an alarm configuration table. It also displays the **Alarm Status**, which is updated based on polling and received traps.

In range 1.0.1.x, the Tag page also contains a **Tag Table Acknowledgement** button, which allows you to configure how acknowledgement is defined:

- **Manually**: For each received alarm, the user needs to set the respective **Alarm Status** to *Acknowledge* in order for the device to stop sending back this alarm.
- **Automatic**: If an alarm is received by the connector, it will automatically send an Acknowledge message to the device.

The 1.0.1.x range also includes a **Polling Configuration** table, which allows you to define the polling intervals for the following groups of parameters:

- **General Status**
- **General Identification**
- **General Configuration**
- **Tag Status**
- **Tag Configuration**

By default, polling for these groups is enabled, and the same polling intervals are used as in previous versions: 30 seconds for fast parameters, 1 minute for medium parameters, and 1 hour for slow parameters.

In the **Polling Table**, you can configure the intervals in the **Time** column, enable or disable the polling in the **State** column, and poll a specific group on demand in the **Refresh on Demand** column.
