## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination, *default value: 80*.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Initialization

No additional configuration of parameters is necessary in a newly created element.

### Redundancy

No redundancy is defined in the connector.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

The connector will use HTTP GET calls to retrieve and set the parameters from the device.

The **Targets** table is polled incrementally, meaning that the target with ID 0 is polled first, up to 199. Should one of the calls fail (status code is not 200) during the polling, then the polling of the Targets table will fail.
