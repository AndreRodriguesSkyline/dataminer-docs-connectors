# Qbit Q8V Codec System

The **Q866 SMB Internet Radio Transcoder** is typically used by small and medium operators to include streamed web radio stations into OTT and cable networks. It converts 4 to 6 internet radio streams (Icecast/Shoutcast) into a DVB-compliant MPEG-2 transport stream. The signals are available via IP (Ethernet).

The **Qbit Q8V Codec System** connector shows status information for the device and can be used to configure the device.

## How to use

The following pages are available:

- The **General** page contains authentication and system parameters.
- On the **Versions** page, you can find the current image and software versions.
- The **Interfaces** page shows a list of all available interfaces.
- The **Inputs** page contains a table with different types of inputs. Two types, **Web Streams** and **Transport Streams**, are supported and can be configured on the corresponding subpages.
- The **Input Selectors** page contains a table with all input selectors.
- The **Encoders** page contains two tables, one for monitoring and one for configuring encoders. An encoder must have a reference to either an input selector (Input Selectors table) or an audio source (Inputs table).
- The **MPEG-2 TS** page contains a table with transport streams. Each transport stream can have multiple destinations and services*,* which can be managed on the **Destinations** and **Services** pages*.*
- The **File Manager** page lists the available files.

Most of the tables have a right-click menu available that offers extra functionality such as adding, editing or deleting an entry.
