# Teleste AC8810

The AC8810 is a dual active output node with optical upstream segmentation. It offers a high output level (Umax 112 QAM/113.0 dBÃ¦V) and supports 1.2 GHz downstream and up to 204 MHz upstream frequencies.

This connector can be used to manually set up elements, or, when deployed with the [Teleste HDM100](xref:Connector_help_Teleste_HDM100) connector, it can be used by automatically created elements for AC8810 nodes connected to the controller.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Connection - Main

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP of the device.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the device. Default value is 2500.

## How to Use

The connector uses **serial** commands to request and push information to and from the node. This communication can be seen in the **Stream Viewer**.

The **Alarm Limits**, **Status**, and **Alarms** pages contain the most important parameters for monitoring.

The **Spectrum** and **Ingress** pages can be used to monitor and import real-time spectrum and ingress measurements that are being performed on the node.

Note: **Changing the** **communication settings** **or device groups** **on the** **Transponder** **page** may cause the element to go into **timeout** for a couple of seconds.
