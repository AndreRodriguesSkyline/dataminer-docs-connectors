## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a smart-serial connection to retrieve the Witbe results and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The DataMiner IP.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination (default: *8000*).

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the Witbe Robot.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

To communicate with the Witbe Maestro Robot, specify the **Email** and **Password** on the General page and click **Login**. Once the connector has successfully logged in, it will retrieve the catalog list available in Witbe.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

The Witbe Maestro connector will receive notifications from the VOD Manager in the parameter with ID = 3. These notifications must contain the information of the assets that need to be tested.

The connector will send a single test for each available device, and once a result is received, it is sent to the VOD Manager.

In range 1.0.1.x, the connector will receive data to monitor the current test on the device. It will monitor the average test time per device and the time since the last test.
