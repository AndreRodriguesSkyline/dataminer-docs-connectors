## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. Specify the bus address in the format **UU.PP**, with UU being the rollnet address and PP being the slot number (chassis is 00). Example: *10.01*.

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

The element created with this connector has the following data pages:

- **General**: Shows the Display, Information Selected to Display and Card in Mode values. Also allows you to check the polling state and enable/disable debug mode.
- **Summary**: Displays the summary of the input state and statistics.
- **Input 1 Valid** and **Input 2 Valid:** Allows you to enable/disable input standards, and check and change the audio pairs and audio and video configurations.
- **Output**: Allows you to verify and change the output configuration and routing options.
- **Genlock and Delay**: Allows you to configure the Genlock, as well as audio and video delays.

## Notes

In the initial version of this protocol, only a subset of the information available in the device is implemented, i.e. the Summary, Input 1, Input 2, Output, Genlock and Delay pages.
