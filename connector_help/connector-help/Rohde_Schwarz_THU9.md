### DVE Modules

This page contains the **DVE Table**. The DVEs representing the transmitters are created with the data in this table.

### Polling Configuration

From version 2.0.0.4 onwards, a **Polling Configuration** table is available where you can define the polling intervals for the following groups of parameters:

- **General Time**
- **General**
- **Transmitter State**
- **Transmitter Configuration**
- **Transmitter/Output**
- **Transmitter/Amplifiers**
- **Transmitter/RF Sensors State**
- **Transmitter/RF Sensors Configuration**
- **Transmitter/Presets**
- **Exciter A State**
- **Exciter A Configuration**
- **Exciter A/Input Selection**
- **Exciter A/Input Configuration**
- **Exciter A/SFN State**
- **Exciter A/SFN Configuration**
- **Exciter A/Regulation**
- **Exciter A/Pre-Correction State**
- **Exciter A/Pre-Correction Configuration**
- **Exciter A/Linear Correction State**
- **Exciter A/Linear Correction Configuration**
- **Exciter A/Non Linear Correction State**
- **Exciter A/Non Linear Correction Configuration**
- **Exciter B State**
- **Exciter B Configuration**
- **Exciter B/Input Selection**
- **Exciter B/Input Configuration**
- **Exciter B/SFN State**
- **Exciter B/SFN Configuration**
- **Exciter B/Regulation**
- **Exciter B/Pre-Correction State**
- **Exciter B/Pre-Correction Configuration**
- **Exciter B/Linear Correction State**
- **Exciter B/Linear Correction Configuration**

- **Exciter B/Non Linear Correction Configuration**
- **Coolant State**
- **Coolant Configuration**
- **Cooling/Pumps**
- **Cooling/Fans**
- **Cooling/Configuration**

By default, polling for these groups is enabled, and they have the same polling intervals as in previous versions of the connector: 1 second for very fast parameters, 5 seconds for fast parameters, 1 minute for medium parameters, and 5 minutes for slow parameters.

In the **Polling Table**, you can configure the intervals in the **Time** column, enable or disable the polling in the **State** column, and poll a specific group on demand in the **Refresh on Demand** column.

### Web Interface

On this page, you can access the web interface of the device. Note that the client machine has to be able to access the device, as otherwise it will not be possible to open the web interface.
