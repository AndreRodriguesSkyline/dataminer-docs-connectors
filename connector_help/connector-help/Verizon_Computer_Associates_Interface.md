## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

### Initialization

The **Process Overview** table is initialized with static values after the element is created. Two processes, *CA_PERF_DATA* and *CA_SUN_OUTAGE_DATA*, are defined in this version.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

### Data Subscription table

In the **Data Subscription** table, KPI and config entries are defined. You can add, edit or delete entries via the right-click menu. This data is used to generate both performance_data and sunoutage_data files.

- Enter the Name (i.e. the name displayed in DataMiner), and the connector automatically adds the alias to the Alias column. If the Name does not occur in the pre-configured pairs, the connector will return an empty string.
- Four types exist in the connector: KPI, N/A, Sun Outage, and Config.

  - **KPI**

### Process Profile table

The **Process Profile** table contains the settings to connect to the Linux Box: protocol, username, password, endpoint (Linux's IP) and remote path. You can add, edit or delete entries via the right-click menu of the table.

### Process Overview table

The element also contains a **Process Overview** table, where you can change the **profile**. The options in the Profile drop-down list correspond to the entries in the **Name** column of the **Process Profile** table.

The connector handles two processes:

1. **CA_SUN_OUTAGE:** This process is executed every day at 11:00 PM and a file is saved in a Linux box via SCP. The values come from the **subscriptions** (Sun Outage entries) present in the **Data Subscription** table.
1. **CA_PERF_DATA:** This process collects trend data (KPI entries) from the collectors (the last hour). The file is saved in the Linux box via SCP.

### Debug page

On the Debug page, a number of parameters are available that can be of use to troubleshoot issues:

- **Debug**: Determines whether the Debug Information page is displayed.

- **Debug State**: Can be enabled to add extra log messages in the Element Log console. By default, this is disabled.

- **Entity Export/Import Settings:** These settings handle the **export of** **configuration files** and **import of provisioning files**. You can:

  - **Enable/disable** the export and import feature with the **Entity Export** and **Entity Import** toggle button, respectively.

  - Specify the **path** where files will be exported and imported, with the **Entity Export Directory** and **Entity Import Directory** parameters, respectively.

  - Switch between exporting/importing to a **local or remote location** by using the toggle button **Entity Export Directory Type** or **Entity Import Directory Type**, respectively.

    Note that for the remote file handling feature to work, you must enter the credentials for the system in the **System Credentials** section and enter the path to the remote directory in the **Entity Export/Import Directory** parameter. The **path** **must be shared/accessible**.

  - Perform an export or import by clicking the **Apply** button in the relevant section.

## Notes

If the **Data Subscription** table is empty, the file will not be created.

If the **Process Profile** table is empty, the file will not be uploaded to the Linux box.
