## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: The slot number of the card in the frame.

SNMP Settings:

- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device (default: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device (default: *private*).

### Initialization

Make sure the Evertz 7X00 Frame Controller connector is also available in the system, as full functionality of this connector, with frame status parameters such as temperature and power supply, will not be available otherwise.

### Redundancy

This platform does not support controller interface redundancy.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The connector will communicate with the frame but will only poll information for the card slot defined during element creation.

All tables are polled via SNMP. Traps are supported.
