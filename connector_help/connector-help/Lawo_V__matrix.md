# Lawo V\_\_matrix

The Lawo V\_\_matrix is a software-defined IP core routing, processing, and multi-viewing platform.

In range 1.0.0.x and 1.1.0.x, the **Ember+** protocol is used to communicate with the device, which is a **smart-serial** way of communicating. The most important functions of the device are polled.

From range 2.0.0.x onwards, **WebSocket** communication is used instead.

From range 2.0.1.x onwards, the information is retrieved via **WebSocket** subscriptions to enhance update speed.
