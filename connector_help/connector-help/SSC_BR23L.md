# SSC BR23L

Satellite Systems (SSC) Model BR23L is a fully agile satellite tracking receiver designed to provide a linear DC reference voltage proportional to the received signal level of a satellite beacon or other SCPC carrier.

## About

The SSC BR23L connector uses a serial protocol to communicate with the BR23L device.

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Serial Main Connection

This connector uses a serial connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SERIAL CONNECTION:

- Interface connection:

  - **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
  - **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
  - **Bus address**: The bus address of the device. If the bus address is empty, communication goes through the RS-232 protocol, otherwise RS-485 is used.

## How to use

This connector consists of only one page, the **General** page. This page contains the monitored system parameters used in the satellite carrier tracking process, the **carrier input frequency,** the **current reference level**, the **current DC reference voltage** and the **carrier tracking status**.
