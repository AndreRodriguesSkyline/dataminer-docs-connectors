## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Main Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

To be able to communicate with the HTTP server, the **API Key** must be filled in on the **General** page.

You can also specify the folder where the CSV files will be exported on the **General** page.

The **Providers** page contains a table displaying all the providers.

The **Assets** page contains a table displaying all the assets. As there can be a large number of assets, this table is not filled in by default. To have it filled in, set the toggle button **Assets Display** to *Enabled.*
