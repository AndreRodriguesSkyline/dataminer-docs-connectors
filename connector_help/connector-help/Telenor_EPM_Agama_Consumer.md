# Telenor EPM Agama Consumer

This virtual connector is used to process CSV files exported by the Agama FireHouse software. Each row in the CSV files contains information about an STB in the Telenor EPM system. The connector will read the files from a shared folder and process each row. Each row is then forwarded to the [Telenor EPM Collector](xref:Connector_help_Telenor_EPM_Collector) element that manages the corresponding STB. To know which STB belongs to which collector, the connector reads a CSV file created by the [Telenor EPM Manager](xref:Connector_help_Telenor_EPM_Manager).

## Configuration

### Connections

#### Virtual connection

This connector uses a virtual connection and does not require any input during element creation.

## How to use

On the **General** page, you can specify the **path** to the folder containing the CSV files. In case it is a shared folder, you also need to specify the **Username**, **Password** and **Domain** to access the folder.

The **County ID** is used to specify from which subfolder the files must be read.

The **Collectors** page displays the list of all the collectors that will receive the processed data.

To fill in the **Collectors** table, set the **Provisioning Folder** parameter to the path containing the provisioning files generated by the **Telenor EPM Manager** and then click the **Provision** button.
