# Grass Valley IQLAM00

The **Grass Valley IQLAM00** provides a fast and efficient way to monitor channel branding, by detecting an on-air logo and comparing it with a stored logo signature file.

Multiple logo files can be stored on the module and loaded via triggers from the automation system as required, to provide confidence that the channel branding is correct.

This connector can be used to control and monitor the Grass Valley IQLAM00 via **SNMP**.
