## Configuration

### Connections

#### SNMP Main Connection

This connector uses a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) connection and requires the following input during element creation:

SNMP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Device address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy.*

SNMP Settings:

- **Port number**: The port of the connected device, by default *161*.
- **Get community string**: The community string used when reading values from the device
  (default value if not overridden in the connector: *public*).
- **Set community string**: The community string used when setting values on the device
  (default value if not overridden in the connector: *private*).

### Initialization

No extra configuration is needed.

### Redundancy

There is no redundancy defined.

## How to use

To start the communication between DataMiner and the Device, it only needs to configure element IP Address. After starting the element, it starts polling data and fill in the active parameters. This device works with a Menu Tree, which has 8 trees. You can found there per sections on the menu pages (left site of the page). These ones are: General, System, Video Signal Waveform (WFM), Vector, Picture, Status, Eye/Jitter and Audio. Each one has parameters which are separate in sections to have an interface more user-friendly. Most of them have a toggle button for set a enable/disable, on/off or start/stop value and, regarding the value some toggle buttons have, other parameters would change his status from "Not Initialized" to the value they have. The polling time for each parameter is 1 hour but each parameter polls when you set a new value.

For the General tree, the parameters are distributed in one page, and those parameters are: Input and Preset parameters.

For the Video Signal Waveform (WFM) tree, the parameters are distributed in 4 pages: WFM (Sweep, Ext. Sync., Gain and Line menus), WFM - Inten/Config (Inten/Config parameters), WFM - Cursor (Cursor parameters) and WFM - Color System (Color system parameters).

For the Vector tree, the parameters are distributed in 3 pages: Vector (Inten/Config, Histogram Scale, 5Bar Scale and Line Select parameters), Vector - Scale (Scale parameters) and Vector - CIE Diagram Scale (Diagram Scale parameters).

For the Picture tree, the parameters are distributed in 4 pages: Picture (Edge, Data, Max Fall and Line Select menu trees parameters), Picture - Configuration (Configuration menu tree parameters), Picture - CineLite (CineLite and CineZone setup parameters) and Picture - Noise Setup (Noise Setup parameters).

For the Status tree, the parameters are distributed in 5 pages: Status (Ext. Ref. Phase, AV Phase, Status Event Log and Dump Operation parameters, Status - Mode (Mode parameters), Status - IP (Packet Jitter, Packet Header PTP, etc.), Status - Ancillary (Ancillary parameters) and Status - Data (Data parameters).

For the Eye/Jitter tree, the parameters are distributed in 3 pages: Eye/Jitter (Data and Peak Hold parameters), Eye/Jitter - Inten/Config (Intensity and Color parameters) and Eye/Jitter - Gain/Filter/Sweep (Gain, Filter and Sweep parameters).

For the Audio tree, the parameters are distributed in 2 pages: Audio (Setup parameters) and Audio - Data (Data parameters).
