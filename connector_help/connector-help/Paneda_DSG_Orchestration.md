## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection - MAIN

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

#### HTTP Connection - REDUNDANT

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

- **IP address/host**: The polling IP or URL of the destination.
- **IP port**: The IP port of the destination.
- **Bus address**: If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *bypassproxy.*

### Initialization

To make sure the connector can start polling, on the **General** page, fill in the **API Token** with the Bearer token key.

### Redundancy

The connector uses a redundant connection (HTTP Connection - REDUNDANT). If the first connection fails, the connector will automatically use this connection instead.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to Use

On the **General** page of this connector, you can initialize the **API Token** to be able to poll data.

The **Debug** page contains basic information about the communication with the device, as well as specific logs for every entry.

The other pages contain status information for the DSG orchestration and general information.
