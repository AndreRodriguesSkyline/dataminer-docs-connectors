## How to Use

A query is executed to retrieve the carrier data from the database.

No data traffic will be seen in the **Stream Viewer**.

On the **General** page, the **Database Connection** data must be filled in.
On the **Carrier Measurements** page, the **Satellite** and **Plan Name** must be filled in. The **Carrier Polling Status** must be set to *Enabled*.

You can add presets to the **Alarm Presets** table and remove presets from this table via the **Delete** button in the Delete column.

The carrier data requested by the query is filled in in the **Carrier** table on the Carrier Measurements page. You can set an alarm preset in the **Alarm Preset** column of the Carrier table. The possible values are taken from the **Alarm Presets** table.
